Money Laundering Charges
Money laundering charges can be serious and complex. We can help.
What is money laundering? Money laundering refers to financial transactions that involve money obtained through criminal activity. Usually, the purpose of a money laundering transaction is to take money earned through illegal activity and make it appear legitimate. It is called “laundering” because it is a process where someone is attempting to take “dirty” money and make it “clean.”
Money laundering occurs whenever money earned through illegal activity is deposited in a bank or other financial institution. Money laundering also occurs wherever illegally obtained money is spent in a way that helps promote or conceal the illegal activity.
In this video, Page Pate explains the different types of money laundering charges under federal law. Page also shows how our firm uses creative legal defenses to effectively respond to money laundering charges in court.

I’ve represented well over 100 people who were facing money laundering charges in federal court. Now, money laundering can be a complicated type of an offense, so I thought it might be helpful to walk through the basics, “What is money laundering, and what type of defenses have we used in the past to win these cases?” Well, to begin with, what is money laundering? Well, to put it simply, it’s taking dirty money, money from criminal activity, and making it clean, making it appear to be legitimate. And so it can be something as simple as taking money that was made from a drug transaction and depositing it into a checking account. That is technically money laundering.
Now, in federal court, we see money laundering charges usually in cases involving some type of underlying financial crime. It can be a drug crime. It can also be a fraud or embezzlement crime. It can be a racketeering/RICO Act-type of crime. Basically, any crime where the person is alleged to have made money, you’re going to see the federal government add money laundering charges to that case, and there’s a good reason for that. In addition to trying to make the person face additional criminal penalties, the government wants to get that money. So they use the money laundering charges as a way to convince a judge, even before the case goes to trial, to let the government seize the money and eventually try to keep it.
Now, there are various types of money laundering charges under federal law. The most common falls under 18 U.S.C. Section 1956. That’s the one that we see most of the time. Now, this is a serious crime. It carries up to 20 years in prison for someone who is convicted. Let’s go through the elements. The first element is that this must involve a financial transaction. And that means you take the money and you go to a bank, or you take the money and you go buy a car, go buy some jewelry. Anything that you do with that money where you’re exchanging it for goods, services, or trying to put it in a bank account is a financial transaction. What is not a financial transaction is if you take that money, give it to someone to hold for you, and all they do is put it in their bedroom or under the mattress. Even though that may be dirty money, it’s not money laundering because there’s no financial transaction.
The second element is that the money must be from a particular crime. It has to be dirty money. Now, the money laundering statute gives a list of different types of crimes that must be involved for the money to be money subject to a money laundering charge, but it’s a long list. So almost any type of federal crime where the person is alleged to have made some money can be the basis for a money laundering charge, as long as the money actually comes from the crime. And of course, the person who’s being charged with money laundering has to know that. They have to know that the money that they’re taking, receiving, or using in some way comes from some type of criminal activity.
And finally, for this type of money laundering offense, the money has to be used or a particular purpose. In other words, you’re taking the money, putting it into a bank account or buying something with it for the purpose of promoting the underlying crime, trying to conceal it, or trying to avoid a reporting requirement, taking the money and dividing it up into less than $10,000, which is a structuring crime and certainly can also be money laundering. But there’s another type of money laundering offense, and that’s found in 18 U.S.C. Section 1957. Also, a very serious crime, but the maximum is 10 years instead of 20 years and the elements are a little different.
First of all, it has to involve a monetary transaction. That’s a little bit different from the other money laundering crime. For this particular crime, the money has to involve a financial institution, a bank, an investment company, securities. You have to actually take the money and give it to some type of financial institution to be guilty of this type of money laundering offense. And there’s a threshold amount. The amount of the transaction has to be more than $10,000. But like the other money laundering charge, the money, of course, has to come from criminal activity and the person has to know that the money is dirty.
Now, there are other types of money laundering charges that kind of fall under these two laws. The first is international money laundering, and that’s basically money laundering that involves the movement of the money from one country to another, some type of international transaction. It can be from the United States to, say, Europe or Asia. Or it can simply involve the United States. Even if the money is moving between two foreign countries, if the United States is somehow involved in that transaction or someone in the United States is involved, then it can qualify for this type of money laundering. What’s interesting about international money laundering is that the money doesn’t actually have to come from a crime. As long as the person is trying to further the criminal activity that they may be involved with, even if the money is otherwise clean, they can be charged and convicted of international money laundering.
Now, we also see a lot of money laundering sting operations. Especially now, I’m seeing more and more of these cases being charged in federal court. Now, obviously, this involves an undercover operation by government agents and we see it two different ways. Either the government will set up some type of business, where they try to convince people to give them dirty money and then charge them with money laundering. Or they will act like they’re criminals, like they’re drug dealers or they’ve committed fraud, and they’ll go out to professionals, people in the community, accountants, merchants, financial advisors, even lawyers, and try to convince them to take money that is dirty.
Now, of course, in a sting operation, the money is not really dirty at all. It’s usually money that’s coming from the government. They’re just pretending that it’s dirty. The key thing, though, is that the person who’s being charged has to think that this money is from a crime, has to think that the money is actually dirty. And the government has a variety of different ways to try to make those suggestions without actually saying the money comes from a crime.
Now, you can also have money laundering conspiracy charges, and that’s basically money laundering, but it involves an agreement between two or more people. What’s interesting about a conspiracy, though, is you never have to take the money to a bank or you never have to actually engage in a transaction. What’s being punished here is the agreement to commit this unlawful act. So even if someone never sees dirty money but they know that there’s an attempt to do something with that dirty money, even if they played a very small role, they can be charged in a money laundering conspiracy.
Now, of course, like any federal case, there are defenses to this type of charge and we’ve used several of these successfully in other cases. The first offense is that the case doesn’t involve a monetary or financial transaction. A great example of this is, say, someone goes to a bank, robs the bank, ends up with a sackful of cash. They take the cash to a friend and say, “Hey, I need you to hide this for me. Go put it out back somewhere.” The other person takes the money, ti’s dirty money clearly, and then they go do something with it, they hide it, they conceal it, but they don’t take it to a bank, they don’t spend it. There’s been no monetary or financial transaction, so that’s not a money laundering case.
An obvious defense is that the money isn’t dirty. You see that in two ways. Either someone’s been involved or charged with being involved in a criminal activity and they’re using money in connection with that case, but the money came from some other source. It wasn’t directly from the criminal activity that was the basis of the case. We mostly see, though, this type of defense, and we used it successfully last month in fraud cases. The government says, “Okay, this person’s engaging in an illegal, fraudulent activity. So any money that they make and spend or use, deposit, has to be money laundering. Well, if you can show that the underlying activity wasn’t fraud to begin with, then the money is not dirty and there’s no money laundering.
You can also defend these charges even when you have dirty money. The money is clearly from a criminal activity, but the person being charged doesn’t know that. A good example of that is a merchant, say, a jeweler or someone who sells cars. And somebody’s got some dirty money, they go to these folks, they buy stuff from them, but the people selling the merchandise, the jewelry, the cars, they don’t know that the money is from an unlawful source. They may have some suggestions, they may have some suspicions, but the government has to show that they knew the money came from criminal activity.
Now, in 1956, that first money laundering charge we talked about, there’s this additional element that the government has to show that not just is the money from a crime, but that the transaction that’s taking place is for a particular purpose. You’re either trying to promote the unlawful activity, conceal it, or to avoid reporting requirements. If the government can’t show that, then that’s a good defense to a 1956 money laundering charge. And finally, if there is an undercover sting operation, you always want to consider an entrapment defense. Did the government go too far? Did they try to push this person to take money that the person really wasn’t interested in taking? Or were they so unclear about the source of the money that the person has a legitimate defense that they had no idea that the money was from any type of crime?
So there are a lot of defenses to money laundering charges. These are very serious charges, very complicated charges. If you’re going through it or know someone who is, you probably have questions. If you have questions, hopefully, we can have some answers. So give us a call and we will do our best to help
Money laundering laws cover both domestic and international financial transactions. International money laundering cases are usually focused on the purpose of the financial transaction. Even a transaction with “clean” money can be the basis of an international money laundering charge if the money is being used to promote a particular crime.
There are two federal criminal laws that specifically address money laundering. The first law (18 U.S.C. §1956) makes it a crime for any person to engage in a financial transaction with money that was obtained from criminal activity with the intent to try and promote the criminal activity or conceal it. The second law (18 U.S.C. §1957) makes it a crime for a person to engage in a monetary transaction in an amount greater than $10,000, knowing that the money was obtained through criminal activity.

Rarely is someone charged with just a money laundering offense. We usually see money laundering charges brought in cases where someone is being accused of drug conspiracy, mail and wire fraud, racketeering (RICO), or some other financially motivated crime.
The government can also use undercover “sting” operations to investigate and prosecute money laundering offenses where the money is not actually “dirty money.” In these “sting” operations, an undercover agent can say that the money is “dirty” even if it is clearly not.
In addition to these crimes, federal law also makes it illegal to enter into an agreement to commit money laundering. Money laundering conspiracy charges are often brought against people who have only played a small role in the alleged criminal activity. In order to prove that someone is part of a money laundering conspiracy, the government must show that there was an agreement to launder money and that the person knew about the agreement and wanted to join in it. The government does not have to prove that the person actually handled the money or did anything specific to assist the money laundering offense.
Money laundering is a serious crime under federal law. A violation of 18 U.S.C. §1956 can result in a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. A violation of 18 U.S.C. §1957 can result in a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. As with most federal financial crimes, the exact sentence will be determined primarily by the amount of money involved in the offense.

Defenses against Money Laundering Charges
In any money laundering case, other than an undercover “sting” operation, the government must prove that the money was in fact derived from a specific criminal activity under federal law. The government must also prove that the person being charged was aware that the money had been obtained from criminal activity.
While the government does not have to prove that the person was aware of the specific crime involved, the government must show that the facts and circumstances of the case would be enough to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the money included the proceeds of illegal activity. A person is not guilty of money laundering if they simply accept money without knowing that the money was obtained through criminal activity.
To convict someone of money laundering, the government must also show that there was a monetary or financial transaction involved. This generally means that the government would have to show that the person did something with the money other than put it in a safe or their closet. Depositing the money in a bank or spending the money in any way that helps promote or conceal criminal activities would normally be enough to show that a financial transaction was involved.
Of course, in any case other than an undercover “sting” operation, the government must show that the money involved in the case actually came from the commission of one of a list of specific crimes covered by federal law. If the money was not derived from one of these specific criminal activities, there can be no money laundering conviction regardless of how the person obtained the money or what the person did with it.
Current trends in money laundering cases
A recent indictment in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia targeted an international money laundering, drug trafficking and illegal wildlife trade conspiracy.
FBI and FinCEN increased focus on possible money laundering transactions during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns for fraud with new relief funds available and banks flagging normal financial activity as suspicious when much activity either stopped or significantly reduced.
Medical and recreational marijuana use is legal in many states but concerns from banks they will violate federal anti-money laundering laws make banking services unavailable.  New laws introduced in the latest Coronavirus legislation will amend the SAFE Banking Act to provide legal access to financial services for marijuana related businesses.

By Dan Byrne for AMLi
The President of Montenegro has angrily dismissed claims that he was involved in an international money laundering ring currently under investigation.  
The scheme is suspected to be linked to over €20M in laundered profits from Italian oil businesses. The money would be sent through Albania and the orchestrators would receive a share of each sum transferred.

Regulatory Watch NewsTakeover Bid of Fortune 500 Company was a ShamSECApril 5, 2022Washington D.C., April 5, 2022 —


The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Melville ten Cate, a U.S. citizen residing abroad, with fraud stemming from his allegedly phony offer to purchase Textron – a large U.S.-listed aircraft, defense, and industrial company.

The SEC’s complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that on November 9, 2020, ten Cate and Xcalibur Aerospace, Ltd., a now-defunct private company ten Cate controlled, placed an advertisement in The New York Times announcing a proposed purchase of all existing stock of Textron for $60.50 a share, a 56 percent premium over the stock’s previous closing price. As alleged, the advertisement led to a spike in Textron trading and a subsequent trading halt. The SEC has charged ten Cate with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

FDIC and FinCEN Highlight Three Teams in Digital Identity Tech SprintFinCENApril 5, 2022WASHINGTON – The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) today highlighted three teams of experts in a Tech Sprint to help measure the effectiveness of digital identity proofing—the process used to collect, validate, and verify information about a person.

Through the Tech Sprint, FDIC and FinCEN sought to increase efficiency and account security; reduce fraud and other forms of identity-related crime, money laundering, and  terrorist financing; and foster customer confidence in the digital banking environment.

Nearly 60 participants were selected from more than 200 others seeking to compete in the Tech Sprint.  These participants formed eight teams to present their solutions to a panel of government judges.Wagner Group subject to asset freeze by the UKOFSIApril 5, 20221 entry has been amended under the Russia financial sanctions regime.

		NARCL chairman Pradip Shah

Price discovery in the times of NARCL


















	Pradip Shah, who had taken charge as the chairman of National Asset Reconstruction Co Ltd (NARCL), stepped down before the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could approve the proposal, State Bank of India (SBI) said.

	Shah, a financial sector veteran, took charge of the NARCL soon after the debt recast firm received the licence from the RBI.

	According to sources familiar to the development, NARCL sought the RBI’s approval for appointing four directors. The application also indicated Shah's role as the chairman of the board.

	“Directors’ appointment is one among the many appro­vals that an ARC requires prior to commencing business,” SBI said in a statement.

	NARCL has been set up by banks to aggregate and consolidate stressed assets for their subsequent resolution. SBI, along with other public sector banks will have 51 per cent stake in NARCL, the government had said.

	“While these requests were under process, Mr Pradip Shah stepped down from the NARCL Board. The RBI approval, therefore, was received only for the remaining directors. The factual position is that Mr Pradip Shah happened to step down prior to receipt of the RBI approval,” the statement said.

	Sources said the RBI approval for the four candidates were sought on January 21, 2022. Shah stepped down from the post on January 28.

	“RBI wanted some more time, some more background check was required,” said a source, requesting anonymity.

	“The standard process for onboarding of directors for an ARC is to seek prior approval of the RBI. In view of the urgency to operationalise NARCL quickly, soon after receipt of RBI licence, a few directors, including Mr Pradip Shah, were onboarded and an application was submitted to RBI for approval,” the SBI said.

	After Shah stepped down, Subrata Biswas, a deputy managing director of SBI and one of the nominee directors of NARCL, was appointed as interim chairman.

	Sources said that NARCL will seek fresh approval from RBI for appointing the chairman. One director’s post in the NARCL board is still vacant.

Anti-money laundering expert convicted for failure to report money laundering


The former chairman of the Association of UK Payment Institutions, which represents payment institutions regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, has been convicted in relation to an £850,000 investment fraud.Dominic Thorncroft was found guilty of failing to alert the authorities to money laundering, retaining wrongful credit (a theft offence) and breaching money laundering regulations.Thorncroft was a self-described money laundering expert whose job was to protect individuals and businesses from economic crime. He also allowed his business accounts to be used by fraudsters to transfer money to Hong Kong and China.Stephane Pendered of the Crown Prosecution Service said, “Thorncroft promoted himself as an anti-money laundering expert but failed to live up to the standards he set for others, so when his business was clearly being used to launder criminal property, he failed to follow his own advice and report what was happening to the authorities.”Crucially, Thorncroft did not commit fraud himself. However, it can be a criminal offence to allow money laundering and to fail to report suspicions or knowledge of money laundering to the authorities.Your business may also be subject to money laundering regulations, and if so, staying on the right side of the law should be a major concern for you.Here, we outline when someone may be penalised for failing to comply with requirements to detect, report and prevent money laundering.What is Money laundering?Money laundering is defined under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (PoCA) as a range of offences “concerning the possession, concealment, conversion, transfer or making of arrangements relating to the proceeds of crime. This is not limited to money or cash”.It is the “process by which the proceeds of crime are converted into assets which appear to have a legitimate origin”.There are two types of money laundering offences:Those who commit money laundering offences and launder the proceeds of crime.Those who only launder the proceeds of crime committed by others.We are concerned with the second type of money laundering offences.The laws behind anti-money launderingAnti-money laundering in the UK is comprised of various laws and regulations, including:The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (PoCA) – the primary law covering money laundering.The Terrorism Act 2000 (TACT) – which focuses on terrorism financing.The Money Laundering Regulations – place anti-money laundering obligations on certain higher-risk private sector industries.Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA) – intended to smooth the Brexit transition in relation to international anti-money laundering standards.What types of business have anti-money laundering duties?Businesses in certain sectors – including accountants, estate agents and financial service businesses – are required to comply with the money laundering regulations and must be monitored by the relevant supervisory authority.Some businesses are regulated by an industry specific body, such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).If a business is not already supervised but it falls into one of seven categories, it must register with HMRC to be able to carry out the typical kinds of activities associated with their type of business. These seven business types are:Money service businesses not supervised by the FCAHigh value dealersTrust or company service providers not supervised by the FCA or professional bodyEstate agentsBill payment services not supervised by the FCATelecommunications, digital and IT payment service providers not supervised by the FCAArt market participantsLetting agenciesIf a business trades without registering, it is a criminal offence.Under the Money Laundering Regulations, supervisory bodies can investigate and impose penalties for breaches.Where a breach of regulations is serious, the body will usually refer the case to criminal enforcement authorities such as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).Failure to comply with the Regulations may lead to criminal offences under PoCA and TACT.What are businesses’ anti-money laundering obligations?Businesses affected by Money Laundering Regulations have responsibilities in their day-to-day course of business to carry out ‘customer due diligence’. This essentially means that customers are who they say they are and that their transactions are legitimate.Such obligations include appointing a ‘nominated officer’, providing sufficient training to employees and record keeping.Money laundering criminal offencesRegulation 45 of the Money Laundering RegulationsRegulation 45 creates the offence for failing to comply with money laundering regulations. It is an ‘either-way offence’, which means it can be tried in either the Magistrates’ Court or Crown Court. Conviction can result in a maximum prison sentence on indictment (conviction in the Crown Court) of up to two years and a fine.It is a defence if the accused took all reasonable steps and exercised sufficient due diligence.Regulation 47 provides that a corporate body (such as a limited company) can also commit an offence under Regulation 45 with the consent, connivance or neglect of one of its officers, in which case both the individual and corporate body can be prosecuted.Failure to disclose – Section 330 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002Under section 330 of PoCA, it is a criminal offence for a business in a regulated sector to fail to disclose knowledge or suspicions of money laundering to a ‘nominated officer’.The offence is committed where a person:Receives information in the course of business.Knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in money laundering.Can identify that person or where the laundered money is (or can assist in identification or finding the whereabouts).Fails to disclose to a ‘nominated officer’.Failure to disclose is an ‘either-way’ offence with a maximum penalty on indictment (conviction in the Crown Court) of up to five years imprisonment and a fine.Get specialist advice about money laundering investigations and prosecutions in BournemouthIf you are being faced with investigation or prosecution for a money laundering offence, you need advice from a lawyer who specialises in this area.We are a dedicated criminal defence firm in Bournemouth, Dorset and one of the leading teams of criminal lawyers in the region.

Share price and reputational damage: banks count cost of AML failings

New head of trade finance at Danske Bank

Banks caught up in money laundering scandals suffer an average 21% slump in their share price, researchers say, as warnings grow over regulatory scrutiny of the trade finance sector. 
Penalties for anti-money laundering (AML) failings worldwide totalled around US$2.2bn in 2020, and another US$1bn in the first half of last year, according to a paper published by Themis, a financial crime intelligence provider and member organisation with a presence in the UK and UAE. 
However, the damage to a bank found guilty of AML-related failings goes well beyond any fine imposed. 
Themis says a sample of seven banks involved in international AML scandals since 2019 shows an average share price loss of 5.2% the day after regulatory action is announced, and a drop of 20.7% over the following six months. 
That reputational hit can “reflect poorly on senior management teams, reducing their chances of re-election by shareholders who have seen the value of their investments plummet”, the paper says. 
“With senior executives frequently granted stock options in addition to their salaries, their own direct interests in the company are also threatened by poor CDD [customer due diligence] processes.” 
There are also potential legal consequences for senior managers who “turn a blind eye” to AML requirements, including potential forced resignation, a ban on operating within the industry or criminal charges, Themis says. 
The paper notes that several Danske Bank executives resigned after the Copenhagen-headquartered lender was caught up in an AML scandal in 2019. The bank was accused by Danish authorities of applying insufficient controls to transactions worth over €200bn through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
Themis points out Danske also reported a 36% fall in its first-quarter net profit in 2019 following the launch of criminal investigations, which contributed to a 7% drop in its share price. 
The paper also cites a fine handed to Commerzbank by UK regulators in 2020, as well as action taken against Westpac in Australia and ABN Amro in the Netherlands during the last two years, as examples of banks’ compliance failings. 
Though those incidents were not related to trade finance, Themis warns that the sector increasingly appears to be in the crosshairs of regulatory authorities. 
In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority wrote to all trade finance chief executives in September last year highlighting “significant issues relating to both credit risk analysis and financial crime controls” across the sector. 
GTR has since revealed that as of October, the FCA had three open investigations under money laundering and terrorist financing regulations which involve trade finance activity. 
“Going forward, we can expect close scrutiny of the trade finance space from regulators. The ‘dear CEO’ letter was just one element of a broader reconfiguration of regulators and financial crime risk managers towards the industry; historically, trade finance garnered relatively little regulatory attention and was considered quite a niche space,” Elizabeth Humphrey, research analyst at Themis, tells GTR.   
“The high-profile fraud and default incidents of 2020/21 changed that, prompting a lasting shift towards more caution and scrutiny around trade finance from regulatory bodies across the globe – from London to Hong Kong, Singapore and New York.” 
Humphrey says regulators are showing heightened attention to banks’ financial crime risk assessments, the threats associated with dual-use goods, and the potential for fraud. 
“​​This shift has been mirrored by risk managers inside banks, who have started to question whether they have enough resources to reliably avoid a situation of the likes of Hin Leong or Greensill,” she says. 
Many lenders have scaled back their exposure to trade finance, particularly at the smaller end of the market, while others have exited entirely. 
The paper recommends that firms carry out thorough due diligence across their entire supply chains, arguing that doing so will boost their reputation for good practice among stakeholders, as well as reduce their risk of exposure to illicit activity. 
Where necessary, enhanced due diligence – such as establishing a client’s source of wealth or funds – is also essential in assessing the risk associated with a particular customer, the paper says. Analysis of a client’s transactional history can help identify “nefarious activity” if transactions do not match expected volumes. 
Technology should be used to map relationships between individuals and entities, scrutinise corporate structures, and improve verification of identity documents, Themis adds.

    NatWest Pleads Guilty to Anti-Money-Laundering Charges
  
The guilty plea is the first criminal prosecution under money-laundering regulations that went into effect in 2007, according to a U.K.’s financial regulator

 















The criminal charges stemmed from operational weaknesses in NatWest’s anti-money-laundering protections, the bank said.

A subsidiary of










            NatWest Group


      PLC pleaded guilty in the U.K. on Thursday to charges that it violated regulations requiring financial institutions to maintain adequate anti-money-laundering systems and controls.
The guilty plea is the first criminal prosecution under money-laundering regulations that went into effect in 2007, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority said.

The criminal charges, brought by the FCA, stemmed from operational weaknesses in the U.K. bank’s anti-money-laundering protections between 2012 and 2016 that caused it to fail to adequately monitor the accounts of an unnamed U.K. incorporated customer, NatWest said.
The case has been sent to the Southwark Crown Court in London for sentencing, the FCA said Thursday. NatWest said the sentencing was expected to be in four to eight weeks, and that it would make a provision in the company’s third-quarter financial statements in anticipation of a potential fine being imposed. The statements are due to be published on Oct. 29.

NatWest said it had cooperated fully with the FCA since the beginning of the investigation.
“We deeply regret that NatWest failed to adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016. NatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties,” NatWest Chief Executive









      
      Alison Rose



      said.
The FCA on Thursday said that no individuals would be charged as part of the proceedings against the bank.
Based on statements made at court, NatWest is likely to be fined between £174 million and £348 million (a range of about $237 million to $474 million in U.S. dollars), according to S&P Global Ratings. The credit rating firm said it expected NatWest’s franchise and daily business activities wouldn’t be materially affected by the fine.
The case demonstrates the challenges faced by large banks in implementing robust prevention and detection processes, and verifying that these controls are deployed effectively across the institution, S&P added.
NatWest has spent nearly £700 million to strengthen its financial crime control systems over the last five years, and plans to invest another £1 billion in the next five years, according to the bank.

Money Laundering
AML expert sentenced in money laundering case2021-08-02T15:48:00+01:00











 














No comments








The former chairman of an industry group who provided anti-money laundering advice and training to lawmakers and financial regulators has been sentenced for offences related to money laundering.Dominic Thorncroft faced one charge of failing to alert the authorities to money laundering, one of breaching money laundering regulations and four charges of retaining a wrongful credit.
Thorncroft, former chairman of the Association of UK Payment Institutions, was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, by a crown court in London. He was also ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work.
Specialist prosecutor Stephane Pendered said: “Dominic Thorncroft did not commit the fraud himself. However, his actions have allowed £850,000 defrauded from 60 individuals to be dispersed across the world.” The sum equates to $1.18m or €995,000.
She added: “Thorncroft promoted himself as an anti-money laundering expert but failed to live up to the standards he set for others, so when his business was clearly being used to launder criminal property, he failed to follow his own advice and report what was happening to the authorities.”
According to Britain’s CPS prosecution service an investigation by London-based Metropolitan Police began in 2016 found evidence linking Thorncroft to an investment fraud which took place in 2014. He had allowed his Money Service Bureau business to be used by the fraudsters to transfer money to Hong Kong and China.
The CPS and the police were able to prove that Thorncroft should have known or suspected that the money passing through his business’s bank accounts was criminal property, the CPS said
“Despite his substantial knowledge and expertise of money laundering, Thorncroft failed to alert the authorities to the suspicious activity and allowed it to continue,” it added.
Thorncroft’s legal representative Kevin Baumber told the court his offending was “characterised by incompetence not deliberation” and he did not have “a guilty mind or sinister motives”, the Financial Times reported.
The presiding judge said it should have been obvious to him that his company was being used to launder money even though the fraud had been sophisticated and well executed. Thorncroft did not benefit financially from the offences, he added.

B.C. lawyer facing money-laundering charges awaits hearings
The Law Society of B.C. has yet to schedule a hearing for a B.C. lawyer facing money-laundering charges in Arizona.

A regulatory hearing for a B.C. lawyer facing money-laundering charges in Arizona will be scheduled soon, according to the Law Society of B.C.
It has been over 28 months since the Southern District of New York ruled Surrey resident Faiyaz Dean committed fraud in relation to an illegal stock scheme commonly known as a ""pump and dump.""
The Nov. 27, 2019 ruling was in relation to civil charges brought forth by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The court expelled Dean from penny stock trading and fined him $160,000. Dean didn’t attend his own trial and the court approved a default judgment.
Dean has also been criminally charged with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud; securities fraud; conspiracy to commit money laundering; and money laundering. Those charges have not been proven in court and the case has also yet to proceed. The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond for comment on the case.
Meanwhile, it’s understood Dean continues to reside in Surrey, after the society issued him a citation last June. However, no hearing has been set. Society spokesperson Jason Kuzminski stated a pre-hearing meeting is expected soon.
The society has accused Dean of multiple incidences of “professional misconduct or conduct unbecoming the profession.”
The citation notes Dean assisted in the U.S. scheme to sell unregistered stock between December 2010 and June 2013, but it appears to include alleged misconduct unrelated to the U.S. charges, including an improper USD $1.1-million transfer.
The society claims Dean worked with multiple companies between approximately November 2014 and December 2016 and “used or permitted the use of your firm’s trust accounts to receive or disburse, or both, some or all of approximately $1,100,000 USD and $170,000 CAD,” without either providing any legal services (as required for trusts) and/or making reasonable inquiries about the circumstances and/or making a record of any inquiries.
Dean also failed to obtain, record and verify identification information for those companies and certain individuals (whose names are redacted), the society alleges.
Dean voluntarily surrendered his licence to the society in December 2019. A hearing panel will determine whether or not Dean did what the society alleges and what penalties, if any, he will face.
Dean remains free to practice law in Washington State, where he attended law school and remains an active member of the Washington State Bar Association; however, this would require entering the United States. 
The SEC determined the 2013 pump and dump generated $34 million in illicit profits by selling stock to retail investors at inflated prices. Dean is said to have profited $120,000 for his part. The SEC reported in 2018 that it was able to locate $16 million in U.S. accounts and return it to harmed investors.
The SEC claim stated how Dean provided the necessary legal framework for the scheme as he helped conceal the beneficial ownership of stock held by the so-called “masterminds” of the scheme, Francisco Abellan Villena and Guillermo Ciupiak. Dean also helped create bank and brokerage accounts in the names of Argentinian nominees that were used to sell Biozoom shares. Accounts were located in Belize, Cyprus, St. Vincent and the British Virgin Islands. Central to the alleged scheme was how Dean set up a shell company with 59.7 million shares that later became Biozoom.
Dean graduated from Seattle University School of Law in 2003. Prior to being called to the B.C. bar in February 2009, Dean articled as a lawyer with Vancouver’s Bacchus Law Group.
Dean went on to set up his own firm, Dean Law Corp., in Seattle and Vancouver, where he purports to specialize in setting up IPOs and reverse mergers for junior start-up companies.
Dean could not be reached for comment.

But some employees are walking away from name-brand institutions in search of more risk, and potentially, more reward.JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are among the firms with dedicated groups for cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology. JPMorgan has one of the largest crypto teams, with more than 200 employees working in its Onyx division. The JPM Coin digital currency is being used commercially to send payments around the world.Umar Farooq, the CEO of Onyx by JPMorgan, said the team has to worry about compliance and protecting the bank's brand and often moves slower than your average crypto start-up. But when products are launched, they reach ""a scale that a fintech can only dream of.""""There aren't many places where you can roll out a new platform and that platform can go from literally nothing to transacting a billion dollars of trade a day in a few months,"" Farooq told CNBC. ""That sort of scale can only be possible when you operate at a company like JPMorgan Chase. The upside of that scale is way more important than whatever downsides might exist by virtue of more regulations or controls.""When it comes to hiring, Farooq said it's a mix of current JPMorgan employees and competing for talent with start-ups and bigger tech companies. From first-year analysts to senior management and managing directors, there's a greater interest in making the move to crypto, he said.A 'Wall St' sign is seen above two 'One Way' signs in New York.Lucas Jackson | ReutersFinancial services firms added three times as many crypto jobs last year than in 2015, according to recent data from LinkedIn. In the first half of 2021, that pace jumped by 40%. Banks on a crypto hiring spree included Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Capital One, Barclays, Credit Suisse, UBS, Bank of America and BNY Mellon.The crypto boom on Wall Street coincides with more funding and hiring in the start-up world. Crypto and blockchain companies raised a record $25 billion last year, an eightfold increase from a year earlier, according to CB Insights data.Farooq said that even with the start-up boom, JPMorgan has seen ""limited attrition."" Those leaving have been people ""wanting to start their own company versus wanting to leave and go do something similar.""However, JPMorgan did lose one of its highest-profile crypto deputies last year. Christine Moy is on garden leave after departing her role as managing director and global head of crypto and metaverse at Onyx. She has yet to announce her next move.""After over a half-decade laying the foundations for blockchain-based infrastructure across financial markets and cross-border payments, creating new businesses that have already scaled into the $USD billions at J.P. Morgan, I am looking to challenge myself further by finding new opportunities to create value and drive impact for the Web3/crypto ecosystem from a new angle,"" Moy told CNBC in an email.Leaving Wall StreetOther top crypto executives who left Wall Street recently expressed some frustration at how long it takes to get projects moving within a large financial institution.Mary Catherine Lader, chief operating officer at Uniswap Labs, left her job as a managing director at BlackRock last year. Her foray into crypto started as a side project within the asset management company.""It certainly wasn't my primary job,"" Lader said. ""It was kind of a hobby, as it is for so many people on Wall Street, and it definitely wasn't something that at the time I was thinking about, because it was early stages of adoption.""VIDEO18:3818:38Uniswap's Mary-Catherine Lader explains why she left BlackRock for cryptoCrypto WorldAt Uniswap, Lader is now working on an emerging decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. She said she couldn't pass up the opportunity to work on the next wave of innovation.""This technology is so critical to the future of finance that it didn't feel like a risk at all,"" Lader said. ""I was sad to leave the people I had loved working with for many years. I have tremendous respect for the firm, but it didn't feel like a risk. That's a great thing about where we are in Web3.""Justin Schmidt, former head of digital asset markets at Goldman Sachs, made a similar career change last year. He joined institutional crypto trading platform Talos and described the risk in a similar way, calling the decision ""multidimensional.""""Inherently, you're taking a brand risk — Goldman is one of the storied institutions of Wall Street,"" Schmidt said. ""You are also taking a risk by staying someplace more traditional, and I very firmly believe that this is a generational change and there's a generational opportunity here.""Cryptocurrency start-ups and banks describe a shift in the hunt for top talent. Many are looking beyond top candidates with MBAs, and instead considering those with less conventional resumes. Lader and Schmidt said some of their best crypto hires have been self-taught engineers or crypto influencers they first interacted with on Twitter.""I constantly am meeting people who are 23 years old, who are as smart about markets as people I worked with on Wall Street for years,"" Lader said. ""People who frankly had no interest in financial services, who would never really explore or consider working on Wall Street, are excited to work at UniSwap Labs and companies like us.""More In Crypto Worldwatch nowVIDEO09:45Terra's $10 billion bitcoin buying spree may be 'catalyst' for sidelined investors: CNBC Crypto WorldPippa Stevenswatch nowVIDEO11:22How fast-moving crypto start-ups lured top talent from Wall Street: CNBC Crypto WorldKate Rooneywatch nowVIDEO18:38Uniswap's Mary-Catherine Lader explains why she left BlackRock for cryptoKate RooneyRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Angered by the West’s economic sanctions, President Vladimir Putin ordered that “unfriendly” countries must start paying for Russian natural gas in roubles, a demand that ministers from the G7 group of countries refused. Gas prices began to rise at the prospect that Mr Putin would turn off the taps. On March 30th Germany began bracing for the worst, taking its first step towards gas rationing. By the end of the day, however, the German government said it had received assurances that European firms would not have to make payments in roubles.Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Listen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEven if an embargo has been averted, the latest confrontation surely strengthens Europe’s desire to relax Mr Putin’s grip on the economy. The EU has vowed to slash imports of natural gas from Russia, which made up some 40% of its consumption of the fuel last year, by two-thirds by the end of 2022. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, dreams that the EU can “get rid” of Russian imports entirely within a few years. Can America, one of the world’s largest natural-gas exporters, help fill the gap?When the Trump administration tried to persuade European officials to reduce their reliance on Russian energy by implementing policies to import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from America—which it dubbed “molecules of freedom”—the proposal was ridiculed. Yet President Joe Biden finds himself doing something very similar to his predecessor. On March 25th he and Ms von der Leyen announced a “groundbreaking” plan to help end the EU’s reliance on Russian gas. It calls for American help in securing an additional 15bn cubic metres of LNG for Europe this year (equal to roughly a tenth of total European imports of Russian gas in 2021). It also promises to “ensure additional EU market demand” for 50bn cubic metres per year of the fuel from America by 2030.Industry insiders have greeted the ambitious plan with scepticism. One reason is that American gas companies face severe infrastructure constraints. The share of American exports going to Europe shot up from 4% in 2017 to almost 30% last year (equivalent to 22bn cubic metres), as prices soared on the continent. America “has almost 100% of its liquefaction capacity already in use”, reckons Rystad, a research firm, meaning that “there is no additional LNG to be exported” in the short term. Jack Fusco, boss of Cheniere, a big American energy company, confirms that his firm is “maxed out”. It would take four or five years and tens of billions of dollars in investment, not to mention the fast-tracking of regulatory approvals, to change that.There are also questions about whether the EU has the infrastructure to cope with the imports. Receiving cargoes of LNG and converting them into usable natural gas requires big facilities for regasification. Europe has spare capacity, but much of it is on the coasts of western countries like Spain and France. Poor interconnections mean that these are not very useful in getting imports to eastern parts of the EU, where an embargo would hit hardest. Germany, which has no LNG terminals, has vowed to build two, but that will take several years. Some European countries talk of acquiring floating LNG terminals, which can be set up more quickly—but there is a severe global shortage of them.Look to the longer term, though, and the new approach to natural gas shows more promise. That is because the EU appears ready to jettison its misguided hostility to long-term gas contracts, which it had discouraged as part of its effort to boost spot markets for gas. The intent had been to promote competition, but, as last winter’s rocketing gas prices revealed, it also left Europe badly exposed to a supply shock. As a top American LNG exporter explains, Europe focused on expanding the spot market when it should have secured “fantastic” long-term pricing instead.Now the commission says it will encourage long-term contracts “to support final investment decisions on both LNG export and import infrastructure”. That should give investors in American export facilities the confidence to spend the billions required, boosting transatlantic trade. Giles Farrer of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, reckons that the infrastructure needed to achieve the aim of 50bn cubic metres of liquefaction capacity in America would cost roughly $25bn, not including upstream investments and supply-chain inflation. Rystad thinks the spending needed to meet Europe’s extra demand could be in the region of $35bn.Diversification away from Russia in the long term, then, may be possible. But that does little to help with the short-term problem of an aggressive Mr Putin. A rational calculus suggests that he should be unwilling to turn off the taps, considering he profits handsomely from high prices. Energy Intelligence, an industry publisher, reckons Gazprom earned $20.5bn from European gas sales in the first two months of the year, nearly as much as it made from Europe in all of 2020. But few observers would dare to predict the actions of an increasingly erratic dictator. ■For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly newsletter.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""A little help from a friend""Reuse this contentThe Trust ProjectMore from Finance & economicsToo much of a good thingAre labour markets in the rich world too tight?Looking in the side-mirrorOmicron is dealing a big blow to China’s economyDiversionary tacticsWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?Side channelsIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketMore from Finance & economicsAre labour markets in the rich world too tight?Certainly in America, and probably elsewhereOmicron is dealing a big blow to China’s economyFor a timely take, analysts are turning to unconventional indicatorsWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainAre labour markets in the rich world too tight?Certainly in America, and probably elsewhereOmicron is dealing a big blow to China’s economyFor a timely take, analysts are turning to unconventional indicatorsWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketThe question is how to pay for Russian oilSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentThe Trust ProjectHelp and contact usKeep updatedFacebookInstagramTwitterLinkedInYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreStoreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist EventsWorking HereWhich MBA?GMAT TutorGRE TutorExecutive JobsExecutive Education NavigatorExecutive Education: The New Global OrderExecutive Education: Business WritingTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCopyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2022.

In this articleCSG.N-CHA sign above the entrance to the Credit Suisse Group AG headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, on Monday, Nov. 1, 2021.Thi My Lien Nguyen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCredit Suisse will face charges in a Swiss court on Monday of allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros, some of it stuffed into suitcases.Swiss prosecutors say the country's second-biggest bank and one of its former relationship managers did not take all necessary steps to prevent the alleged drug traffickers from hiding and laundering cash between 2004 and 2008.""Credit Suisse unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it and is convinced that its former employee is innocent,"" the bank said in a statement to Reuters.In the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland, prosecutors are seeking around 42.4 million Swiss francs in compensation from Credit Suisse, which added that it would ""defend itself vigorously in court"".The case has attracted intense interest in Switzerland, where it is seen as a test for a potentially tougher stance by prosecutors against the country's banks. The indictment runs to more than 500 pages, and centers on relationships that Credit Suisse and its ex-employee had with former Bulgarian wrestler Evelin Banev and multiple associates, two of whom are charged in the case. A second indictment in the case charges a former relationship manager at Julius Baer with facilitating money laundering.A legal representative for the ex-Credit Suisse employee, who cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, said the case was unjustified and his client denied wrongdoing.A lawyer for the two alleged gang members, who face charges of multiple counts of misappropriation, fraud and forgery of documents in the Swiss federal court but cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, declined to comment. A lawyer for the former relationship manager at Julius Baer did not respond to requests for comment. VIDEO10:3210:32What's happened to Swiss banks?CNBC ExplainsBanev, who does not face charges in Switzerland, was convicted of drug trafficking in Italy in 2017 and then in Bulgaria in 2018 for being part of a criminal organization active in trafficking tones of cocaine from Latin America. He vanished, but was arrested in September in Ukraine, from where Bulgarian prosecutors are seeking his extradition to face charges of setting up an organized criminal group and drug trafficking, Interpol's red list of wanted persons shows.Banev and his legal representatives could not be reached for comment. A lawyer who represented Banev in his Bulgarian trial said she was no longer representing him. Julius Baer, which is not facing charges, declined to comment on the case.   Cash in casesThe former Credit Suisse employee brought at least one Bulgarian customer who was an associate of Banev with her when she joined Credit Suisse in 2004, prosecutors allege in the indictment.VIDEO4:3504:35Credit Suisse 'a great franchise' despite legacy issues, strategist saysSquawk Box EuropeThe customer, who was later shot dead as he left a restaurant with his wife in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2005, had begun placing suitcases full of cash in a safe deposit box at Credit Suisse, the indictment says. Prosecutors allege the gang used so-called smurfing, where a large sum of money is broken down into smaller amounts which are below the anti-money laundering alert threshold, to launder money, putting millions of euros in small-value bills into safety deposit boxes and later transferring them into accounts. Although Swiss private banks have since adopted much tougher anti-money laundering so-called know-your-client checks after international pressure, the defendants said this was standard practice at the time the deposits were made.The prosecutors allege the former relationship manager, who left Credit Suisse in 2010 after being detained for two weeks by police in 2009, helped conceal the criminal origins of money for the clients by carrying out more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions, including 43 million francs in cash. ""Our client is being unfairly accused, because Swiss law requires that a person be implicated in order to condemn a bank,"" attorneys at law firm MANGEAT LLC, representing the ex-employee, told Reuters. ""She is innocent, outraged by the accusations. We will plead for her full and complete acquittal.""VIDEO4:3004:30Accident like Archegos must not happen again, Credit Suisse CEO saysSquawk Box EuropeCredit Suisse disputes the illegal origin of the money, a source familiar with its thinking told Reuters, saying that Banev and his circle operated legitimate businesses in construction, leasing and hotels.The Swiss bank, which the indictment says considered Bulgaria as a high-risk country at the time, plans to draw attention to calls made by its compliance department to Swiss prosecutors after Banev was temporarily arrested in Bulgaria in April 2007, the source added.Credit Suisse is hoping that the court will view that its compliance department's move was a sign of the bank taking its anti-money laundering obligations seriously and of cooperating with prosecutors in the matter.In June 2007, the prosecutors asked Credit Suisse for information on accounts held by Banev and his associates in response to a request from Bulgaria, the source added.Noticing a series of withdrawals, the bank's compliance department asked prosecutors whether to freeze the accounts, but were told not to do so in order not to tip the clients off, according to the source. VIDEO3:1903:19There needs to be more disclosure by family offices: Vanity Fair's William CohanSquawk on the StreetBy the time prosecutors gave Credit Suisse the go-ahead, much of the money had been withdrawn.The prosecutors' office declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was now in the hands of the court.The second indictment filed by federal prosecutors against the former relationship manager at Julius Baer, which is being tried in the same court case, alleges some of the funds were transferred to another Swiss bank.The former relationship manager, who left a few months after the transfers took place, is charged with facilitating money laundering.The bank had refused to accept a suitcase filled with cash from the defendants, the indictment says.
