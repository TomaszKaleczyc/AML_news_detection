Page ContentThe concerned authorities deal strictly with anyone who legitimizes or conceals the origin of the money acquired or originated from acts criminalized under Sharia or laws.The Anti- Money Laundering Permanent Committee (AMLPC) affirms that money-laundering crimes pose a serious risk to the economic and social aspects of any country, especially those of which implement weak measures in the fight against such crimes.According to AMLPC, money laundering emerges from money launderers legitimizing funds resulting from other crimes, known by law as predicate offences. This includes all offenses committed within, or any act committed outside the Kingdom if it constitutes a crime according to the laws of the State where it was committed and would have constituted an offense under the Sharia or statutory laws of the Kingdom had it been committed therein.It is noteworthy that AMLPC chaired by Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) includes representatives from the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Commerce and Investment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labor and Social Development, Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah and Guidance, Presidency of State Security, Public Prosecution, Presidency of General Intelligence, Capital Market Authority. AMLPC was formed pursuant to the Council of Ministers Resolution No. (15) dated 17/1/1420 H corresponding to 3/5/1999 AD to implement the FATF's 40 recommendations to combat money laundering operations in accordance with the regulations in force in Saudi Arabia. One of AMLCP's tasks is to implement the above recommendations and follow up the implementation, as well as to study all topics related to combating money laundering in Saudi Arabia.The Committee pointed out that the spread of money laundering operations in any society leads to increasing crime rates, and declining in the values of education and culture because the rapid gains of those crimes do not require a scientific qualification to commit it. Money laundering operations in any country may lead to the spread of shadow economy or commercial concealment, resulting to decline the economic growth, in addition to high inflation rates, which can raise the prices, subsequently, undermining fair competition. It also has adverse effects on other business activities.The Anti-Money Laundering Law was issued by Royal Decree No. (M/20) dated 5/2/1439 AH, superseding the Anti-Money Laundering Law issued by Royal Decree No. (M / 31) dated 11/05/1433 AH. The crime of money laundering is considered a major offense requiring detention pursuant to Decision No. 2000 issued by His Highness the Minister of Interior in 1435. The authorities' concerned deal strictly with anyone who legitimizes or conceals the origin of the money acquired or originating from acts criminalized under Sharia or laws; such as illicit trafficking in drugs, weapons, currency counterfeiting and other crimes. Concealing the true origin of money (laundering) is not limited to cash, but includes assets, property and economic resources of whatever value, type or manner of ownership. When such funds arise directly or indirectly from the commission of a predicate offense, they are called proceeds. It is worthy to point out that a person conviction of money laundering crime is unconditional to the conviction of committing a predicate offence such as illicit drug trafficking.Saudi Arabia has imposed severe penalties for money launderers, as conviction for this crime is subject to a fine of up to seven million riyals and imprisonment for up to fifteen years or both. A Saudi convicted of money laundering shall be banned from traveling outside Saudi Arabia for a period similar to that of sentenced imprisonment. A non-Saudi convicted of money laundering shall be deported from the country after the execution of the sentence. The penalty of the crime of money laundering may be reduced if the perpetrator reports the crime to the competent authorities before they find out, or has reported the perpetrators and his report leads to their arrest or seizure of funds, instrumentalities or proceeds of the crime.​

(AP Photo/Hussein Malla, File)BEIRUT (AP) — Authorities in three European countries have frozen more than $130 million in assets linked to an investigation into money laundering in Lebanon, a European Union agency said Monday.The measures taken by officials in France, Germany and Luxembourg come as Lebanon grapples with a devastating economic crisis and coincide with domestic and European investigations of its longtime central bank governor, Riad Salameh. The crisis, which started in October 2019, is rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement and has continued with no serious steps by the country’s political class to work for a solution.The European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, or Eurojust, said the investigation targets five suspects accused of money laundering. It did not identify the five, adding that they are suspected of embezzling public funds in Lebanon amounting to more than $330 million and 5 million euros ($5.5 million) respectively, between 2002 and 2021.ADVERTISEMENTIt said the assets that were frozen on Friday amount to 120 million euros ($131.6 million).It was not immediately clear if the case is linked to the investigation of Salameh, who was charged by a Lebanese judge earlier this month with illegal enrichment and money laundering. Salameh’s brother, Raja, has been under arrest since March 17, over corruption charges.BusinessEXPLAINER: 5 key takeaways from the March jobs reportCalifornia corporate diversity law ruled unconstitutionalEXPLAINER: What's next for Europe's natural gas during war?New vehicles must average 40 mpg by 2026, up from 28 mpgThe Salameh brothers’ assets have been frozen in Lebanon under an order from a judge in the Lebanese money laundering case. A Lebanese judge had said that Riad Salameh had used his brother to buy real-estate in France worth nearly $12 million.There have also been reports that a brokerage firm, Forry Associates Ltd., owned by Raja Salameh, was hired by the central bank to handle government bond sales in which the firm received $330 million in commissions. The governor, who has denied all charges of corruption, calling them politicized, said last November that “not a single penny of public money” was used to pay Forry Associates Ltd.A Eurojust spokesperson contacted by The Associated Press refused to name the people targeted saying: “We can never give information on suspects.”Eurojust said the suspects in the main investigation “are assumed to be innocent until they have been proven guilty, according to law.”It said judicial authorities in Germany seized assets worth more than 35 million euros ($38.4 million). French authorities seized assets worth at least 18.2 million euros ($20 million) and bank accounts worth 46 million euros ($50.5 million) in Monaco. They also seized a building in Brussels worth 7 million euros ($7.7 million).In Luxembourg, approximately 11 million euros ($12 million) were seized across several bank accounts, it said.ADVERTISEMENTA Lebanese banker said the Eurojust statement “did not give any hint, or proof or a fact that the assets frozen are linked or related in any way into Forry’s operations,” although he noted the numbers involved were similar. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.Riad Salameh, who has not been arrested, has steered Lebanese finances since 1993, through post-war recovery and bouts of unrest. He was once praised as the guardian of Lebanon’s financial stability but has drawn increasing scrutiny since the meltdown started in 2019. He is also being investigated in several European nations, including Switzerland and France, for potential money laundering and embezzlement.AP NEWSTop StoriesVideoContact UsAccessibility StatementCookie SettingsDownload AP NEWSConnect with the definitive source for global and local newsMore from APap.orgAP InsightsAP Definitive Source BlogAP Images SpotlightAP ExploreAP BooksFollow APThe Associated PressAboutContactCustomer SupportCareersTerms & ConditionsPrivacyAll contents © copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Apollomics doses first subject in Phase III AML therapy trial in China
The trial will enrol approximately 140 adults at nearly 20 blood cancer clinical research centres in the country. 

























Apollomics has dosed the first participant in a Phase III clinical trial of its new drug, APL-106 (uproleselan injection), in China to treat relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients.
Uproleselan has been licensed by Apollomics in the Greater China region from GlycoMimetics, which discovered and developed the drug.
The drug can potentially hinder E-selectin from adhering to blood cancer cells, to destroy the leukemic cell resistance mechanism within the bone marrow microenvironment.
The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, bridging trial will assess uproleselan efficacy along with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

Nealy 140 adults with primary refractory or relapsed AML, who are eligible for induction chemotherapy, will be enrolled in the trial. 


  

 
Overall survival is the primary goal of the trial while remission rate and duration; and uproleselan’s ability to reduce oral mucositis rate will be included as secondary goals.
The company plans to carry out the trial at nearly 20 blood cancer clinical research centres in the country.
This trial is part of Apollomics’ complete development programme in China, which also comprises a Phase I pharmacokinetic and tolerability trial currently underway.
Apollomics co-founder, chairman and CEO Guo-Liang Yu said: “As our first Phase III clinical trial, dosing of the first patient with APL-106 is a major inflection point for Apollomics as we now become a company in late-stage development.
“APL-106 acts via an innovative mechanism that drives cancer cells out of the bone marrow, making them a prime target to be killed by chemotherapy.
“This combined treatment approach could have a meaningful impact on the lives of patients living with relapsed or refractory AML.”
AML is a kind of cancer that affects blood and bone marrow.

Sentences for money laundering getting longer: research

Immediate custodial sentences for money laundering and other regulatory breaches are getting longer, making compliance increasingly important for business.




New research by Thomson Reuters showed the average length of prison sentences handed down to people convicted of money laundering had risen from 20.5 months to 27 months between 2008 and 2018.
The increasing use of custodial sentences is likely to make companies focus on compliance with regulations. 
In the past few years the UK government has introduced a number of measures designed to reduce money laundering, including a register of beneficial ownership for UK companies and the use of unexplained wealth orders (UWOs). 
Sentencing guidelines introduced in October 2014 gave English and Welsh judges guidance on the sentencing of bribery and money laundering offences for the first time and were designed to encourage a consistent approach to the sentencing of these offences. 
UWOs were introduced in January 2018 and require individuals to explain where their wealth has come from. Bodies such as HM Revenue & Customs, the Serious Fraud Office and the National Crime Agency have the ability to apply to the High Court for a UWO to freeze and forfeit funds in bank and building society accounts.
The Thomson Reuters research, reported by the Financial Times (subscription required) also said fines for money laundering offences were now less common. In 2013 fines were handed down in 13% of money laundering cases, but this had dropped to 7% last year. 
The harm caused by economic crime is well documented and the UK government has been consistent in its determination to make it as difficult as possible for criminal proceeds to be laundered through the UK, with the introduction of tools such as UWOs and the register of beneficial ownership, with further reforms on the horizon as loopholes are closed. 
An effective deterrent depends not just on legislation and regulation, however, but on effective, consistent and transparent enforcement. The courts have the tools for this and, as we have seen with other regulatory breaches - for example, in health and safety and environmental matters - are increasingly using them to their full force to bring home the message that misconduct will not be tolerated. Immediate custodial sentences are no longer reserved for the most flagrant breaches and are becoming increasingly commonplace for a variety of regulatory misdemeanours. With such high stakes at play, compliance issues cannot be ignored.
The EU’s 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which was published in November last year and comes into force in December 2020 across the EU, proposed an increase in the minimum prison sentence for money laundering offences for individuals from one year to four years, alongside a variety of other ‘dissuasive’ sanctions. Conviction on indictment in the UK allows imprisonment for longer than this already.

Oil jumps more than 5% on Russia tensions
Fallout from war in Ukraine could cut global economic growth by ""over 1% point"" in first year after invasion, says OECD 

By AFP 

March 17, 2022 










The price of benchmark oil contract, Brent North Sea crude, jumped more than 5% to back above $100 per barrel after Russia rejected a ruling from the UN's court to suspend its Ukraine offensive. Photo: AFP  LONDON: Oil prices soared Thursday on tensions surrounding key producer Russia, as equities diverged with traders tracking also interest rate decisions and China's pledge to support volatile markets.The price of benchmark oil contract, Brent North Sea crude, jumped more than 5% to back above $100 per barrel after Russia rejected a ruling from the UN's top court to suspend its Ukraine offensive.




""Russia's invasion is still dictating price action... given the country's global importance in terms of supply,"" Interactive Investor analyst Victoria Scholar told AFP.The fallout from the war in Ukraine could cut global economic growth by ""over 1% point"" in the first year after the invasion, the OECD grouping of developed economies said in a report.The impact ""if sustained"" would produce ""a deep recession in Russia"" and further increase global consumer price inflation by approximately 2.5% points, it added.The warning came as Russia's finance ministry said it had carried out interest payments on two foreign bonds, avoiding default for now after it was hit by unprecedented Western sanctions over Ukraine.Central banksCentral banks were also in focus with the Bank of England expected to announce a third straight interest rate rise to combat decades-high UK inflation.The Bank of England (BoE) gives its latest rate decision at 1200 GMT, a day after the Federal Reserve lifted US borrowing costs to tackle soaring prices.""The global economy faces elevated levels of inflation because of various factors, including from surging energy and commodity prices,"" noted Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarkets.""While the Fed has just started its hiking cycle, the BoE is well on the way, having raised interest rates in its previous two meetings.""In Asia, Hong Kong's main stocks index closed with another massive gain, as investors pile back in after China's pledge to support markets.The Hang Seng surged 7%, a day after a 9% jump.Another blistering surge in tech firms helped Hong Kong extend its recovery from the recent rout, while traders also cheered soothing comments on the US economy by the Fed after it lifted interest rates.China's top economic official has vowed measures to support beaten-down markets and indicated that a debilitating crackdown on the technology sector was nearing its end.""The statement addressed so many issues on various fronts, which is really rare,"" said Ding Shuang at Standard Chartered.""Selloffs tended to be self-fulfilling partly because of the lack of response from the government,"" but part of the government's aim is likely to break that inertia and stabilise expectations, he added.Key figures around 1045 GMTBrent North Sea crude: UP 5.0% at $102.95 per barrelWest Texas Intermediate: UP 4.5% at $99.27 per barrelLondon - FTSE 100: UP 0.1% at 7,296.04 pointsFrankfurt - DAX: DOWN 0.6% at 14,352.04Paris - CAC 40: FLAT at 6,588.75EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.3% at 3,877.75Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 7.0% at 21,501.23 (close)Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 3.5% at 26,652.88 (close)Shanghai - Composite: UP 1.4% at 3,215.04 (close)New York - DOW: UP 1.6% at 34,063.10 (close)Euro/dollar: UP at $1.1039 from $1.1038 late WednesdayPound/dollar: UP at $1.3180 from $1.3148Euro/pound: DOWN at 83.75 pence from 83.90 penceDollar/yen: DOWN at 118.59 yen from 118.73 yen

    NatWest Pleads Guilty to Anti-Money-Laundering Charges
  
The guilty plea is the first criminal prosecution under money-laundering regulations that went into effect in 2007, according to a U.K.’s financial regulator

 















The criminal charges stemmed from operational weaknesses in NatWest’s anti-money-laundering protections, the bank said.

A subsidiary of










            NatWest Group


      PLC pleaded guilty in the U.K. on Thursday to charges that it violated regulations requiring financial institutions to maintain adequate anti-money-laundering systems and controls.
The guilty plea is the first criminal prosecution under money-laundering regulations that went into effect in 2007, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority said.

The criminal charges, brought by the FCA, stemmed from operational weaknesses in the U.K. bank’s anti-money-laundering protections between 2012 and 2016 that caused it to fail to adequately monitor the accounts of an unnamed U.K. incorporated customer, NatWest said.
The case has been sent to the Southwark Crown Court in London for sentencing, the FCA said Thursday. NatWest said the sentencing was expected to be in four to eight weeks, and that it would make a provision in the company’s third-quarter financial statements in anticipation of a potential fine being imposed. The statements are due to be published on Oct. 29.

NatWest said it had cooperated fully with the FCA since the beginning of the investigation.
“We deeply regret that NatWest failed to adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016. NatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties,” NatWest Chief Executive









      
      Alison Rose



      said.
The FCA on Thursday said that no individuals would be charged as part of the proceedings against the bank.
Based on statements made at court, NatWest is likely to be fined between £174 million and £348 million (a range of about $237 million to $474 million in U.S. dollars), according to S&P Global Ratings. The credit rating firm said it expected NatWest’s franchise and daily business activities wouldn’t be materially affected by the fine.
The case demonstrates the challenges faced by large banks in implementing robust prevention and detection processes, and verifying that these controls are deployed effectively across the institution, S&P added.
NatWest has spent nearly £700 million to strengthen its financial crime control systems over the last five years, and plans to invest another £1 billion in the next five years, according to the bank.

Only one conviction in last four years under AML law, MPs panel told


By Our Correspondent 

December 02, 2021 










ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has informed the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance that the tax authorities have attached properties worth Rs235 billion, in total 215 registered FIRs, during the last four years under the Anti Money Laundering (AML) law.




The National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance met under chairmanship of Faiz Ullah here at the Parliament House on Wednesday. When the parliamentarians inquired about convictions before a court of law under the AML to satisfy the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the FBR high-ups replied that the first conviction was achieved in a case based in Peshawar related to Inland Revenue (IR).However, there was no conviction on Customs side, said FBR’s Director General Intelligence & Investigation of Inland Revenue Aamir Talpur, while testifying before the NA panel. “To implement the AML Law, we have registered 215 FIRs against 267 accused and attached properties worth Rs235 billion involving a tax amount of Rs76 billion. The FBR also attached 640 bank accounts.The Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) sends us Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) after receiving and analyzing data from 8 to 9 relevant agencies."" The FBR cannot close down an investigation on its own, Aamir Talpur said.The Chairman of NA Panel, Faiz Ullah, raised concerns by Faisalabad's business community on the rampant use of AML laws against them and argued that tax evasion and money laundering should be dealt with separately. PMLN leader Ahsan Iqbal also argued that the laws were bulldozed in haste to pass this AML law to victimize Mian Nawaz Sharif, but now this law was being used to harrass businessmen. The Chairman FBR, Dr. Ashfaque Ahmed, said tax evasion having linkages of criminal proceeds was handed over to the jurisdiction of tax machinery. Despite limited workforce, he said that the FBR had to perform reluctantly in accordance with the mandate given by the Parliament.The FBR’s DG I&I IR, Aamir Talpur, said that Financial Monitoring Unit is the focal point for receiving all data and after analysing it, Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) are prepared, which are forwarded to the relevant law enforcing agencies. In case of tax-related issues of Income Tax or Sales Tax, the STRs were forwarded to FBR’s Inland Revenue and in case of Customs, it is forwarded to FBR’s Customs Intelligence Wing. He cited the example of an 80-year-old person who deposited multimillion rupees cash while declaring taxable income of just Rs0.2 million. He said that the FBR collected evidence and presented it before the court of law following which the properties and banks accounts were attached, he added.The PPP Parliamentarian's Dr. Nafisa Shah asked for furnishing details of Saudi loan deposit and oil facility to the tune of $4.2 billion for one year, in the next meeting at which the Director General Debt Ministry of Finance requested for an in-camera session for sharing details of the Saudi agreement.The Ministry of Finance also presented Federal Government Properties Management Bill 2021 before the committee. The new bill proposed to establish Property Management Authority under a Director General for three years tenure. Following this, a board will also be established and this Authority will have the mandate to develop properties for commercial purposes. It will have the powers to mortgage, rent, or lease out government-owned properties.PPP MNA Dr. Nafisa Shah and PMLN's Ahsan Iqbal strongly opposed the bill, arguing it would open a new Pandora's box. They asked for incorporating the viewpoint of major stakeholders such as railways, defense ministry, ports and shipping and others because neither the ministries nor the departments would be willing to hand over their properties to the proposed authority. The committee deferred its approval for the next meeting.

Penalties for anti-money laundering (AML) failings worldwide totalled around US$2.2bn in 2020, and another US$1bn in the first half of last year, according to a paper published by Themis, a financial crime intelligence provider and member organisation with a presence in the UK and UAE. 
However, the damage to a bank found guilty of AML-related failings goes well beyond any fine imposed. 
Themis says a sample of seven banks involved in international AML scandals since 2019 shows an average share price loss of 5.2% the day after regulatory action is announced, and a drop of 20.7% over the following six months. 
That reputational hit can “reflect poorly on senior management teams, reducing their chances of re-election by shareholders who have seen the value of their investments plummet”, the paper says. 
“With senior executives frequently granted stock options in addition to their salaries, their own direct interests in the company are also threatened by poor CDD [customer due diligence] processes.” 
There are also potential legal consequences for senior managers who “turn a blind eye” to AML requirements, including potential forced resignation, a ban on operating within the industry or criminal charges, Themis says. 
The paper notes that several Danske Bank executives resigned after the Copenhagen-headquartered lender was caught up in an AML scandal in 2019. The bank was accused by Danish authorities of applying insufficient controls to transactions worth over €200bn through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
Themis points out Danske also reported a 36% fall in its first-quarter net profit in 2019 following the launch of criminal investigations, which contributed to a 7% drop in its share price. 
The paper also cites a fine handed to Commerzbank by UK regulators in 2020, as well as action taken against Westpac in Australia and ABN Amro in the Netherlands during the last two years, as examples of banks’ compliance failings. 
Though those incidents were not related to trade finance, Themis warns that the sector increasingly appears to be in the crosshairs of regulatory authorities. 
In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority wrote to all trade finance chief executives in September last year highlighting “significant issues relating to both credit risk analysis and financial crime controls” across the sector. 
GTR has since revealed that as of October, the FCA had three open investigations under money laundering and terrorist financing regulations which involve trade finance activity. 
“Going forward, we can expect close scrutiny of the trade finance space from regulators. The ‘dear CEO’ letter was just one element of a broader reconfiguration of regulators and financial crime risk managers towards the industry; historically, trade finance garnered relatively little regulatory attention and was considered quite a niche space,” Elizabeth Humphrey, research analyst at Themis, tells GTR.   
“The high-profile fraud and default incidents of 2020/21 changed that, prompting a lasting shift towards more caution and scrutiny around trade finance from regulatory bodies across the globe – from London to Hong Kong, Singapore and New York.” 
Humphrey says regulators are showing heightened attention to banks’ financial crime risk assessments, the threats associated with dual-use goods, and the potential for fraud. 
“​​This shift has been mirrored by risk managers inside banks, who have started to question whether they have enough resources to reliably avoid a situation of the likes of Hin Leong or Greensill,” she says. 
Many lenders have scaled back their exposure to trade finance, particularly at the smaller end of the market, while others have exited entirely. 
The paper recommends that firms carry out thorough due diligence across their entire supply chains, arguing that doing so will boost their reputation for good practice among stakeholders, as well as reduce their risk of exposure to illicit activity. 
Where necessary, enhanced due diligence – such as establishing a client’s source of wealth or funds – is also essential in assessing the risk associated with a particular customer, the paper says. Analysis of a client’s transactional history can help identify “nefarious activity” if transactions do not match expected volumes. 
Technology should be used to map relationships between individuals and entities, scrutinise corporate structures, and improve verification of identity documents, Themis adds.

But some employees are walking away from name-brand institutions in search of more risk, and potentially, more reward.JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are among the firms with dedicated groups for cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology. JPMorgan has one of the largest crypto teams, with more than 200 employees working in its Onyx division. The JPM Coin digital currency is being used commercially to send payments around the world.Umar Farooq, the CEO of Onyx by JPMorgan, said the team has to worry about compliance and protecting the bank's brand and often moves slower than your average crypto start-up. But when products are launched, they reach ""a scale that a fintech can only dream of.""""There aren't many places where you can roll out a new platform and that platform can go from literally nothing to transacting a billion dollars of trade a day in a few months,"" Farooq told CNBC. ""That sort of scale can only be possible when you operate at a company like JPMorgan Chase. The upside of that scale is way more important than whatever downsides might exist by virtue of more regulations or controls.""When it comes to hiring, Farooq said it's a mix of current JPMorgan employees and competing for talent with start-ups and bigger tech companies. From first-year analysts to senior management and managing directors, there's a greater interest in making the move to crypto, he said.A 'Wall St' sign is seen above two 'One Way' signs in New York.Lucas Jackson | ReutersFinancial services firms added three times as many crypto jobs last year than in 2015, according to recent data from LinkedIn. In the first half of 2021, that pace jumped by 40%. Banks on a crypto hiring spree included Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Capital One, Barclays, Credit Suisse, UBS, Bank of America and BNY Mellon.The crypto boom on Wall Street coincides with more funding and hiring in the start-up world. Crypto and blockchain companies raised a record $25 billion last year, an eightfold increase from a year earlier, according to CB Insights data.Farooq said that even with the start-up boom, JPMorgan has seen ""limited attrition."" Those leaving have been people ""wanting to start their own company versus wanting to leave and go do something similar.""However, JPMorgan did lose one of its highest-profile crypto deputies last year. Christine Moy is on garden leave after departing her role as managing director and global head of crypto and metaverse at Onyx. She has yet to announce her next move.""After over a half-decade laying the foundations for blockchain-based infrastructure across financial markets and cross-border payments, creating new businesses that have already scaled into the $USD billions at J.P. Morgan, I am looking to challenge myself further by finding new opportunities to create value and drive impact for the Web3/crypto ecosystem from a new angle,"" Moy told CNBC in an email.Leaving Wall StreetOther top crypto executives who left Wall Street recently expressed some frustration at how long it takes to get projects moving within a large financial institution.Mary Catherine Lader, chief operating officer at Uniswap Labs, left her job as a managing director at BlackRock last year. Her foray into crypto started as a side project within the asset management company.""It certainly wasn't my primary job,"" Lader said. ""It was kind of a hobby, as it is for so many people on Wall Street, and it definitely wasn't something that at the time I was thinking about, because it was early stages of adoption.""VIDEO18:3818:38Uniswap's Mary-Catherine Lader explains why she left BlackRock for cryptoCrypto WorldAt Uniswap, Lader is now working on an emerging decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. She said she couldn't pass up the opportunity to work on the next wave of innovation.""This technology is so critical to the future of finance that it didn't feel like a risk at all,"" Lader said. ""I was sad to leave the people I had loved working with for many years. I have tremendous respect for the firm, but it didn't feel like a risk. That's a great thing about where we are in Web3.""Justin Schmidt, former head of digital asset markets at Goldman Sachs, made a similar career change last year. He joined institutional crypto trading platform Talos and described the risk in a similar way, calling the decision ""multidimensional.""""Inherently, you're taking a brand risk — Goldman is one of the storied institutions of Wall Street,"" Schmidt said. ""You are also taking a risk by staying someplace more traditional, and I very firmly believe that this is a generational change and there's a generational opportunity here.""Cryptocurrency start-ups and banks describe a shift in the hunt for top talent. Many are looking beyond top candidates with MBAs, and instead considering those with less conventional resumes. Lader and Schmidt said some of their best crypto hires have been self-taught engineers or crypto influencers they first interacted with on Twitter.""I constantly am meeting people who are 23 years old, who are as smart about markets as people I worked with on Wall Street for years,"" Lader said. ""People who frankly had no interest in financial services, who would never really explore or consider working on Wall Street, are excited to work at UniSwap Labs and companies like us.""More In Crypto Worldwatch nowVIDEO11:22How fast-moving crypto start-ups lured top talent from Wall Street: CNBC Crypto WorldKate Rooneywatch nowVIDEO18:38Uniswap's Mary-Catherine Lader explains why she left BlackRock for cryptoKate Rooneywatch nowVIDEO09:24Defiance ETFs' Sylvia Jablonski remains 'completely bullish' on bitcoin: CNBC Crypto WorldTanaya MacheelRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

U.K. bank hit with huge fine over anti-money laundering lapses



The NatWest sanction follows the regulator’s first criminal prosecution for money-laundering violations

After pleading guilty to violating provisions of anti-money laundering rules, U.K. bank National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) was hit with a £264.8-million fine.
The sanctions follow the first criminal prosecution for money laundering failings by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 







NatWest pleaded guilty and was convicted for three offences of failing to comply with money laundering regulations.
According to the FCA, the charges stemmed from NatWest’s failure to properly monitor the activity of jewellery business Fowler Oldfield between November 2012 to June 2016.
During that time, the company deposited approximately £365 million with the bank, including £264 million in cash.
“Some of the bank’s employees, who were responsible for handling these cash deposits, reported their suspicions to bank staff responsible for investigating suspected money laundering, however no appropriate action was ever taken,” the FCA said.
Following an investigation by West Yorkshire Police, 11 people pleaded guilty to charges relating to the cash deposits and three cash couriers were charged. Another 13 people are awaiting trial in the case. The trial is set for April 2022.
Justice Cockerill, the sentencing judge at Southwark Crown Court, said that while the bank was “in no way complicit” in the money laundering, it was “functionally vital.”
“Without the bank — and without the bank’s failures — the money could not be effectively laundered,” the judge said.
Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said NatWest was responsible for “a catalogue of failures” in how it scrutinised suspicious transactions.
“Combined with serious systems failures, like the treatment of cash deposits as cheques, these failures created an open door for money laundering,” he said in a release.
“We deeply regret that we failed to adequately monitor one of our customers between 2012 and 2016 for the purpose of preventing money laundering,” NatWest CEO Alison Rose said in a statement.
“While today’s hearing brings an end to this case, we will continue to invest significant resources in the ongoing fight against financial crime.”

""Outstanding work by Tesla team & key suppliers saved the day.""Tesla delivered 310,048 vehicles in the quarter, a slight increase from the previous quarter, and up 68% from a year earlier.

    Two-Year Treasury Yield Climbs Above 10-Year Again
  
Bond yields move higher as March employment report shows wages continue to rise

 















Labor Department data show that the economy added 431,000 jobs in March.

          Updated April 1, 2022 3:58 pm ET
        











Yields on U.S. government bonds climbed Friday, aided by a strong jobs report, after a burst of quarter-end buying had driven them lower in recent sessions.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.374%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 2.324% Thursday.
 Short-term Treasury yields rose more than longer-term yields, reflecting expectations that the Fed could start raising its benchmark federal-funds rate in half-percentage-point increments in coming meetings in an effort to tame inflation.
The two-year yield settled at 2.430%, compared with 2.284% Thursday. It was the first time the two-year yield closed above the 10-year yield since 2019, a sign investors think the Fed could start cutting rates in response to slowing economic growth not long after it has finished raising them.


Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed in the overnight session. Shorter-term yields, especially, then took another leg upward after data from the Labor Department showed that the economy added 431,000 jobs in March and that average hourly earnings increased 0.4% from the previous month.
Bond investors have been particularly focused on wage gains, which can be a long-term driver of overall inflation. The data for March showed that wages are still climbing at a rapid clip, returning to trend after they were reported to be nearly flat in the previous data release.
“Overall, this is an extremely consensus payrolls report that will keep the Fed on track” to raise rates by half a percentage point at its May meeting, Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.
Friday’s trading suggested that a tough period for bond investors may not be over after they got a reprieve in recent sessions—with the 10-year yield declining after reaching 2.5% in intraday trading on March 25.
Despite the last-minute rally, bonds still suffered their worst quarter in four decades, thanks to continued high inflation and escalating expectations for how much the Fed could tighten monetary policy over the next two years.
The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate bond index—largely U.S. Treasurys, highly rated corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities—returned minus 5.9% over the first three months of the year, its biggest quarterly loss since 1980.











          An inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve has been seen as a recession warning sign for decades, and it looks like it’s about to light up again. WSJ’s Dion Rabouin explains why an inverted yield curve can be so reliable in predicting recession and why market watchers are talking about it now. Illustration: Ryan Trefes

By Dan Byrne for AMLi
The President of Montenegro has angrily dismissed claims that he was involved in an international money laundering ring currently under investigation.  
The scheme is suspected to be linked to over €20M in laundered profits from Italian oil businesses. The money would be sent through Albania and the orchestrators would receive a share of each sum transferred.

Regulatory Watch NewsFormer GE Power Engineer Convicted of Conspiracy to Commit Economic EspionageUS Department of JusticeApril 1, 2022Yesterday, a federal jury convicted a New York man of conspiracy to commit economic espionage following a four-week jury trial.

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, Xiaoqing Zheng, 59, of Niskayuna, was employed at GE Power & Water in Schenectady, New York, as an engineer specializing in sealing technology. He worked at GE from 2008 until the summer of 2018. The trial evidence demonstrated that Zheng and others in China conspired to steal GE’s trade secrets surrounding GE’s steam and gas turbine technologies, knowing or intending to benefit the People’s Republic of China and one or more foreign instrumentalities, including China-based companies that research, develop, and manufacture parts for turbines.Treasury Targets Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) Weapons of Mass Destruction Organization and SubsidiariesOFACApril 1, 2022WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today sanctioned five entities for providing support to the DPRK’s development of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs in violation of multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions (UNSCRs). The DPRK has conducted a series of escalatory ballistic missile launches in the past several months, including most recently the DPRK’s February 26, March 4, and March 24 intercontinental ballistic missile launches (ICBM), which demonstrate the DPRK’s clear determination to continue developing its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs. These ballistic missile tests are brazen violations of multiple UNSCRs, needlessly raise tensions, and risk destabilizing the security situation in the region.  Today’s action targets a DPRK WMD research and development organization that is directly linked to the development of the DPRK’s ICBMs, along with four of its revenue generating subsidiaries.FinCEN Assesses $275,000 Civil Money Penalty against A&S World Trading for Violating Geographic Targeting OrderFinCENApril 1, 2022WASHINGTON—The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on March 31 assessed a $275,000 civil money penalty on A&S World Trading, Inc., d/b/a Fine Fragrance (A&S) for willful violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulations. This is FinCEN’s first enforcement action for failing to comply with a Geographic Targeting Order.

A&S admits that it failed to comply with the reporting and recordkeeping requirements of a  Geographic Targeting Order issued to certain nonfinancial trades and businesses located within the Los Angeles Fashion District. Because of these violations, A&S failed to report more than two millions dollars in high-risk currency transactions.
