Page ContentThe concerned authorities deal strictly with anyone who legitimizes or conceals the origin of the money acquired or originated from acts criminalized under Sharia or laws.The Anti- Money Laundering Permanent Committee (AMLPC) affirms that money-laundering crimes pose a serious risk to the economic and social aspects of any country, especially those of which implement weak measures in the fight against such crimes.According to AMLPC, money laundering emerges from money launderers legitimizing funds resulting from other crimes, known by law as predicate offences. This includes all offenses committed within, or any act committed outside the Kingdom if it constitutes a crime according to the laws of the State where it was committed and would have constituted an offense under the Sharia or statutory laws of the Kingdom had it been committed therein.It is noteworthy that AMLPC chaired by Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) includes representatives from the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Commerce and Investment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labor and Social Development, Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah and Guidance, Presidency of State Security, Public Prosecution, Presidency of General Intelligence, Capital Market Authority. AMLPC was formed pursuant to the Council of Ministers Resolution No. (15) dated 17/1/1420 H corresponding to 3/5/1999 AD to implement the FATF's 40 recommendations to combat money laundering operations in accordance with the regulations in force in Saudi Arabia. One of AMLCP's tasks is to implement the above recommendations and follow up the implementation, as well as to study all topics related to combating money laundering in Saudi Arabia.The Committee pointed out that the spread of money laundering operations in any society leads to increasing crime rates, and declining in the values of education and culture because the rapid gains of those crimes do not require a scientific qualification to commit it. Money laundering operations in any country may lead to the spread of shadow economy or commercial concealment, resulting to decline the economic growth, in addition to high inflation rates, which can raise the prices, subsequently, undermining fair competition. It also has adverse effects on other business activities.The Anti-Money Laundering Law was issued by Royal Decree No. (M/20) dated 5/2/1439 AH, superseding the Anti-Money Laundering Law issued by Royal Decree No. (M / 31) dated 11/05/1433 AH. The crime of money laundering is considered a major offense requiring detention pursuant to Decision No. 2000 issued by His Highness the Minister of Interior in 1435. The authorities' concerned deal strictly with anyone who legitimizes or conceals the origin of the money acquired or originating from acts criminalized under Sharia or laws; such as illicit trafficking in drugs, weapons, currency counterfeiting and other crimes. Concealing the true origin of money (laundering) is not limited to cash, but includes assets, property and economic resources of whatever value, type or manner of ownership. When such funds arise directly or indirectly from the commission of a predicate offense, they are called proceeds. It is worthy to point out that a person conviction of money laundering crime is unconditional to the conviction of committing a predicate offence such as illicit drug trafficking.Saudi Arabia has imposed severe penalties for money launderers, as conviction for this crime is subject to a fine of up to seven million riyals and imprisonment for up to fifteen years or both. A Saudi convicted of money laundering shall be banned from traveling outside Saudi Arabia for a period similar to that of sentenced imprisonment. A non-Saudi convicted of money laundering shall be deported from the country after the execution of the sentence. The penalty of the crime of money laundering may be reduced if the perpetrator reports the crime to the competent authorities before they find out, or has reported the perpetrators and his report leads to their arrest or seizure of funds, instrumentalities or proceeds of the crime.​

(AP Photo/Hussein Malla, File)BEIRUT (AP) — Authorities in three European countries have frozen more than $130 million in assets linked to an investigation into money laundering in Lebanon, a European Union agency said Monday.The measures taken by officials in France, Germany and Luxembourg come as Lebanon grapples with a devastating economic crisis and coincide with domestic and European investigations of its longtime central bank governor, Riad Salameh. The crisis, which started in October 2019, is rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement and has continued with no serious steps by the country’s political class to work for a solution.The European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, or Eurojust, said the investigation targets five suspects accused of money laundering. It did not identify the five, adding that they are suspected of embezzling public funds in Lebanon amounting to more than $330 million and 5 million euros ($5.5 million) respectively, between 2002 and 2021.ADVERTISEMENTIt said the assets that were frozen on Friday amount to 120 million euros ($131.6 million).It was not immediately clear if the case is linked to the investigation of Salameh, who was charged by a Lebanese judge earlier this month with illegal enrichment and money laundering. Salameh’s brother, Raja, has been under arrest since March 17, over corruption charges.BusinessSuddenly, Tesla's Elon Musk is Twitter's biggest stakeholderRussia war could further escalate auto prices and shortagesBillions, and more, for lawmakers' projects in spending billSmall businesses in need of a loan find banks are stingyThe Salameh brothers’ assets have been frozen in Lebanon under an order from a judge in the Lebanese money laundering case. A Lebanese judge had said that Riad Salameh had used his brother to buy real-estate in France worth nearly $12 million.There have also been reports that a brokerage firm, Forry Associates Ltd., owned by Raja Salameh, was hired by the central bank to handle government bond sales in which the firm received $330 million in commissions. The governor, who has denied all charges of corruption, calling them politicized, said last November that “not a single penny of public money” was used to pay Forry Associates Ltd.A Eurojust spokesperson contacted by The Associated Press refused to name the people targeted saying: “We can never give information on suspects.”Eurojust said the suspects in the main investigation “are assumed to be innocent until they have been proven guilty, according to law.”It said judicial authorities in Germany seized assets worth more than 35 million euros ($38.4 million). French authorities seized assets worth at least 18.2 million euros ($20 million) and bank accounts worth 46 million euros ($50.5 million) in Monaco. They also seized a building in Brussels worth 7 million euros ($7.7 million).In Luxembourg, approximately 11 million euros ($12 million) were seized across several bank accounts, it said.ADVERTISEMENTA Lebanese banker said the Eurojust statement “did not give any hint, or proof or a fact that the assets frozen are linked or related in any way into Forry’s operations,” although he noted the numbers involved were similar. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.Riad Salameh, who has not been arrested, has steered Lebanese finances since 1993, through post-war recovery and bouts of unrest. He was once praised as the guardian of Lebanon’s financial stability but has drawn increasing scrutiny since the meltdown started in 2019. He is also being investigated in several European nations, including Switzerland and France, for potential money laundering and embezzlement.AP NEWSTop StoriesVideoContact UsAccessibility StatementCookie SettingsDownload AP NEWSConnect with the definitive source for global and local newsMore from APap.orgAP InsightsAP Definitive Source BlogAP Images SpotlightAP ExploreAP BooksFollow APThe Associated PressAboutContactCustomer SupportCareersTerms & ConditionsPrivacyAll contents © copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Apollomics doses first subject in Phase III AML therapy trial in China
The trial will enrol approximately 140 adults at nearly 20 blood cancer clinical research centres in the country. 

























Apollomics has dosed the first participant in a Phase III clinical trial of its new drug, APL-106 (uproleselan injection), in China to treat relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients.
Uproleselan has been licensed by Apollomics in the Greater China region from GlycoMimetics, which discovered and developed the drug.
The drug can potentially hinder E-selectin from adhering to blood cancer cells, to destroy the leukemic cell resistance mechanism within the bone marrow microenvironment.
The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, bridging trial will assess uproleselan efficacy along with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

Akston to launch Phase II trial of Covid-19 booster vaccine in Netherlands







Nealy 140 adults with primary refractory or relapsed AML, who are eligible for induction chemotherapy, will be enrolled in the trial. 


  

 
Overall survival is the primary goal of the trial while remission rate and duration; and uproleselan’s ability to reduce oral mucositis rate will be included as secondary goals.
The company plans to carry out the trial at nearly 20 blood cancer clinical research centres in the country.
This trial is part of Apollomics’ complete development programme in China, which also comprises a Phase I pharmacokinetic and tolerability trial currently underway.
Apollomics co-founder, chairman and CEO Guo-Liang Yu said: “As our first Phase III clinical trial, dosing of the first patient with APL-106 is a major inflection point for Apollomics as we now become a company in late-stage development.
“APL-106 acts via an innovative mechanism that drives cancer cells out of the bone marrow, making them a prime target to be killed by chemotherapy.
“This combined treatment approach could have a meaningful impact on the lives of patients living with relapsed or refractory AML.”
AML is a kind of cancer that affects blood and bone marrow.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Third Founder Of Cryptocurrency Exchange Pleads Guilty To Bank Secrecy Act Violations
Samuel Reed Designed BitMEX as a Platform to Flout U.S. Anti-Money Laundering Rules
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that SAMUEL REED, one of three co-founders and a high-ranking executive of purportedly “off-shore” cryptocurrency derivatives exchange the Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange or “BitMEX,” pled guilty today to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”) by willfully failing to establish, implement, and maintain an anti-money laundering (“AML”) program at BitMEX.  Under the terms of his plea agreement, REED agreed to separately pay a $10 million criminal fine representing pecuniary gain derived from the offense.  REED pled guilty today before Chief U.S. District Judge Laura T. Swain, and will be sentenced by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl.  The other two founders of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, previously pled guilty to the same offense in February 2022.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said:  “Samuel Reed has now joined his co-founders, Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, in admitting that they caused BitMEX to commit criminal violations of the anti-money laundering laws that govern financial institutions operating in the United States.  As today’s guilty plea reflects, this Office will not permit cryptocurrency exchanges to operate as a shadow financial system that enables criminal actors to move their illicit proceeds without detection, and will vigorously investigate and prosecute the operators of such exchanges who deliberately flout U.S. law.”
According to the Indictment, public court filings, and statements made in court:[1]
REED, together with Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, was one of the three co-founders and the long-time Chief Technology Officer of BitMEX.  BitMEX is an online cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that, during the relevant time period, had U.S.-based operations and served thousands of U.S. customers, notwithstanding false representations to the contrary by the company.  From at least September 2015, and continuing at least through the time of the Indictment in September 2020, REED willfully caused BitMEX to fail to establish and maintain an AML program, including a program for verifying the identify of BitMEX’s customers (or a “know your customer” or “KYC” program).  As a result of its willful failure to implement AML and KYC programs, BitMEX was in effect a money laundering platform.  For example, in about May 2018, REED was notified of allegations that BitMEX was being used to launder the proceeds of a cryptocurrency hack.  Neither REED nor the company filed a suspicious activity report thereafter (indeed, BitMEX filed no suspicious activity reports at all between 2014 and September 2020), nor did BitMEX implement an AML or KYC program in response. 
REED failed to institute AML or KYC programs at BitMEX despite closely following U.S. regulatory developments that made clear his legal obligation to do so if BitMEX operated in the United States, which it did.  Despite repeatedly stating that BitMEX did not serve U.S. customers, including to individuals outside of BitMEX, REED knew that BitMEX’s purported withdrawal from the U.S. market in or about September 2015 was a sham, and that purported “controls” BitMEX put in place to prevent U.S. trading were an ineffective facade that did not, in fact, prevent users from accessing or trading on BitMEX from the United States.  REED not only understood that U.S. customers continued to trade on BitMEX, but derived substantial profits from BitMEX as a result of U.S.-based trading. 
*                *                *
REED, 32, of Massachusetts, pled guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentence in this case is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.
Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI’s New York Money Laundering Investigation Squad, and thanked the attorneys and investigators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission whose expertise and diligence were integral to the development of this investigation.
The prosecution is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jessica Greenwood, Samuel Raymond, and Thane Rehn are in charge of the prosecution. 


[1] Two of REED’s co-defendants, Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, pled guilty to violating the BSA in February 2022. As to REED’s remaining co-defendant, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.

Oil jumps more than 5% on Russia tensions
Fallout from war in Ukraine could cut global economic growth by ""over 1% point"" in first year after invasion, says OECD 

By AFP 

March 17, 2022

Photo: AFP  LONDON: Oil prices soared Thursday on tensions surrounding key producer Russia, as equities diverged with traders tracking also interest rate decisions and China's pledge to support volatile markets.The price of benchmark oil contract, Brent North Sea crude, jumped more than 5% to back above $100 per barrel after Russia rejected a ruling from the UN's top court to suspend its Ukraine offensive.




""Russia's invasion is still dictating price action... given the country's global importance in terms of supply,"" Interactive Investor analyst Victoria Scholar told AFP.The fallout from the war in Ukraine could cut global economic growth by ""over 1% point"" in the first year after the invasion, the OECD grouping of developed economies said in a report.The impact ""if sustained"" would produce ""a deep recession in Russia"" and further increase global consumer price inflation by approximately 2.5% points, it added.The warning came as Russia's finance ministry said it had carried out interest payments on two foreign bonds, avoiding default for now after it was hit by unprecedented Western sanctions over Ukraine.Central banksCentral banks were also in focus with the Bank of England expected to announce a third straight interest rate rise to combat decades-high UK inflation.The Bank of England (BoE) gives its latest rate decision at 1200 GMT, a day after the Federal Reserve lifted US borrowing costs to tackle soaring prices.""The global economy faces elevated levels of inflation because of various factors, including from surging energy and commodity prices,"" noted Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarkets.""While the Fed has just started its hiking cycle, the BoE is well on the way, having raised interest rates in its previous two meetings.""In Asia, Hong Kong's main stocks index closed with another massive gain, as investors pile back in after China's pledge to support markets.The Hang Seng surged 7%, a day after a 9% jump.Another blistering surge in tech firms helped Hong Kong extend its recovery from the recent rout, while traders also cheered soothing comments on the US economy by the Fed after it lifted interest rates.China's top economic official has vowed measures to support beaten-down markets and indicated that a debilitating crackdown on the technology sector was nearing its end.""The statement addressed so many issues on various fronts, which is really rare,"" said Ding Shuang at Standard Chartered.""Selloffs tended to be self-fulfilling partly because of the lack of response from the government,"" but part of the government's aim is likely to break that inertia and stabilise expectations, he added.Key figures around 1045 GMTBrent North Sea crude: UP 5.0% at $102.95 per barrelWest Texas Intermediate: UP 4.5% at $99.27 per barrelLondon - FTSE 100: UP 0.1% at 7,296.04 pointsFrankfurt - DAX: DOWN 0.6% at 14,352.04Paris - CAC 40: FLAT at 6,588.75EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.3% at 3,877.75Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 7.0% at 21,501.23 (close)Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 3.5% at 26,652.88 (close)Shanghai - Composite: UP 1.4% at 3,215.04 (close)New York - DOW: UP 1.6% at 34,063.10 (close)Euro/dollar: UP at $1.1039 from $1.1038 late WednesdayPound/dollar: UP at $1.3180 from $1.3148Euro/pound: DOWN at 83.75 pence from 83.90 penceDollar/yen: DOWN at 118.59 yen from 118.73 yen

   U.K. regulators handed down a record level of anti-money laundering penalties to banks in 2021, and experts anticipate fines to remain elevated as the country's Financial Conduct Authority embraces its powers to pursue criminal prosecutions.
Cases led by the Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, against NatWest Group PLC, Credit Suisse AG and HSBC Holdings PLC helped to drive the value of U.K. anti-money laundering fines to $672 million in 2021, more than tripling from $206 million in 2020, according to research by regulatory technology company Fenergo.
""In the past, fines were seen just as the cost of doing business,"" said Nick Baxter, a U.K.-based banking consultant and director at Rockstead, a provider of regulatory compliance services. ""Now you've got to a point where the fines are so great, it's no longer cheaper to pay the fine and not fix the systems and controls.""
Regulators across Europe are issuing larger fines than previously, said Rachel Woolley, global director of financial crime at Fenergo. There has been ""a shift in the narrative"" in that ""eye-watering penalties"" are no longer coming exclusively from U.S. regulators, Woolley said.
The increase in total fines value in Europe, and the U.K. in particular, bucked the global trend in 2021. The value of penalties related to breaches of anti-money laundering, sanctions, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and data privacy regulation worldwide halved last year, with U.S.-issued fines down about 75%, according to the research.

Beware the watchdog
The fact that the FCA is prepared to use its criminal powers has made it ""a more powerful force,"" said Tony Wyatt, associate counsel at Ewing Law.
A case against NatWest in 2021 was the first time the FCA pursued criminal charges against a bank since it was given such powers under 2007 money-laundering regulation. It resulted in a U.K. court issuing a £264.8 million fine to NatWest in December 2021, after the bank pleaded guilty to failing to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited hundreds of millions of pounds in cash over five years. CEO Alison Rose said at the time that NatWest regretted the failure and that it takes its responsibility to prevent and detect financial crime ""extremely seriously.""
The conviction was a ""big win"" for the FCA and will likely give it the confidence to pursue criminal enforcement actions in the future, said Julian Hui, a senior associate in the financial services regulatory practice at law firm Baker McKenzie in London.
""The FCA is demonstrating that it can actually do these big criminal enforcements and get big outcomes. [The NatWest conviction] will probably embolden it a little bit,"" Hui said.
The regulator told the Financial Times it has about 40 active anti-money laundering cases, the paper reported Jan. 17. Of those, 29 are regulatory investigations, two are criminal investigations and three are civil probes, while six are ""dual-track,"" meaning they could result in either criminal or civil action.
Court-issued fines can be much larger than those granted directly by the regulator, Hui said. The reputational concern for banks being found guilty of a criminal offense ""is massive,"" Wyatt said, adding that, once dealing with criminal law, directors in a bank can also become personally liable.
Hui expects the FCA to pursue at least one more criminal prosecution related to anti-money laundering regulation in the coming year or two. The big unknown is whether reported staffing shortages might start to bite, Hui said. The FCA had to turn to private law firms to help process applications and spent almost £1 million on headhunters in 2021 amid a high number of vacancies, the Financial Times reported in December.
When asked about the regulator's appetite to use its power to pursue criminal convictions, an FCA spokesperson said via email that anti-money laundering cases ""remain a strategic priority"" and that it ""will take whatever enforcement action is necessary based on the evidence.""
New European narrative
Europe, the Middle East and Africa was the only region in which the value of financial penalties increased in 2021, jumping to $3.45 billion from just over $1 billion in 2020, according to Fenergo.

Three of the five largest money-laundering penalties in 2021 came from Europe. These include a €1.8 billion fine issued to UBS AG after a French court found it had concealed serious tax fraud and illegal banking activities in the country, and a €480 million settlement between ABN AMRO Bank NV and Dutch prosecutors over anti-money laundering failings. The NatWest fine in the U.K. was the fifth-largest penalty of the year.
The U.S. continued to rank among the top issuers of financial fines, though penalties dropped to $1.20 billion in 2021 from $4.40 billion a year earlier, according to Fenergo. While U.S. regulators in the past have issued material fines to non-U.S. banks, 2021 saw a larger focus on local banks, with penalties generally of a lower value, Woolley said.

						Convicted money launderer who smuggled millions out of the UK wanted by the NCA

          Convicted money launderer who smuggled millions out of the UK wanted by the NCA        




            Money laundering          



The NCA is appealing for information on the whereabouts of a convicted money launderer who talked of moving up to £50 million out of the UK every month.
Abdul Fahad, 41, of Meads Lane, Ilford, was arrested by NCA officers in 2018 after bundles of cash totalling more than £100,000 were found in his car.

He was charged with multiple money laundering offences after further cash was located at his home, alongside evidence of frequent and suspicious trips to the United Arab Emirates.
Fahad initially told NCA officers that the cash seized had come from life savings, and from the sale of property and stocks.
He also stated he was a sole trader dealing in cars and that he intended to pay the money into a bank to buy a car.
However, the investigation found that Fahad was in regular contact with Sathar Khan, a money launderer jailed in 2018 for attempting to board a flight to Dubai with almost £1.5 million pounds cash in his suitcases.
Officers recovered messages from Fahad’s phone, showing a handwritten note detailing a schedule of dates for travel to Dubai between himself and Khan.
Between 2017 and 2018, the two men made nearly 200 return flights with both frequently travelling out with a significantly greater weight of luggage than they returned with.
NCA investigators estimate that Fahad left the UK with an extra 379 kilos over the offending period, which would equate to around £5 million in cash.
Messages on Fahad’s phone also detailed conversations with another would-be cash courier, with one message reading: “Giv me some work too… so I can earn too.’
Further messages revealed that Fahad and Khan discussed sending two couriers per day on money laundering runs during July and August 2018.
Money laundering experts estimate that, if successful, this may have seen up to £50 million moved out of the UK in the period.
Fahad appeared before Southwark Crown Court in September this year, where he pleaded guilty to three money laundering charges. He was granted bail but later absconded.
He was sentenced in his absence to eight years in prison on 16 December.
Law enforcement partners in the UAE provided valuable assistance to the NCA investigation.
Jason Hulme, Operations Manager at the National Crime Agency said:
“Fahad was at the heart of a multi-million-pound money laundering conspiracy, moving cash which would have been derived from serious and organised crime in the UK and internationally.
“We are seeking information on his whereabouts in order that he is made to serve his prison sentence. We believe he could be in East London, particularly around the Ilford or East Ham area and has connections to Dubai and Sri Lanka.
“Anyone with information should report to the NCA Control Centre on 0370 496 7622 quoting Operation Blissless or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”

Share price and reputational damage: banks count cost of AML failings

New head of trade finance at Danske Bank

Banks caught up in money laundering scandals suffer an average 21% slump in their share price, researchers say, as warnings grow over regulatory scrutiny of the trade finance sector. 
Penalties for anti-money laundering (AML) failings worldwide totalled around US$2.2bn in 2020, and another US$1bn in the first half of last year, according to a paper published by Themis, a financial crime intelligence provider and member organisation with a presence in the UK and UAE. 
However, the damage to a bank found guilty of AML-related failings goes well beyond any fine imposed. 
Themis says a sample of seven banks involved in international AML scandals since 2019 shows an average share price loss of 5.2% the day after regulatory action is announced, and a drop of 20.7% over the following six months. 
That reputational hit can “reflect poorly on senior management teams, reducing their chances of re-election by shareholders who have seen the value of their investments plummet”, the paper says. 
“With senior executives frequently granted stock options in addition to their salaries, their own direct interests in the company are also threatened by poor CDD [customer due diligence] processes.” 
There are also potential legal consequences for senior managers who “turn a blind eye” to AML requirements, including potential forced resignation, a ban on operating within the industry or criminal charges, Themis says. 
The paper notes that several Danske Bank executives resigned after the Copenhagen-headquartered lender was caught up in an AML scandal in 2019. The bank was accused by Danish authorities of applying insufficient controls to transactions worth over €200bn through its Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015. 
Themis points out Danske also reported a 36% fall in its first-quarter net profit in 2019 following the launch of criminal investigations, which contributed to a 7% drop in its share price. 
The paper also cites a fine handed to Commerzbank by UK regulators in 2020, as well as action taken against Westpac in Australia and ABN Amro in the Netherlands during the last two years, as examples of banks’ compliance failings. 
Though those incidents were not related to trade finance, Themis warns that the sector increasingly appears to be in the crosshairs of regulatory authorities. 
In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority wrote to all trade finance chief executives in September last year highlighting “significant issues relating to both credit risk analysis and financial crime controls” across the sector. 
GTR has since revealed that as of October, the FCA had three open investigations under money laundering and terrorist financing regulations which involve trade finance activity. 
“Going forward, we can expect close scrutiny of the trade finance space from regulators. The ‘dear CEO’ letter was just one element of a broader reconfiguration of regulators and financial crime risk managers towards the industry; historically, trade finance garnered relatively little regulatory attention and was considered quite a niche space,” Elizabeth Humphrey, research analyst at Themis, tells GTR.   
“The high-profile fraud and default incidents of 2020/21 changed that, prompting a lasting shift towards more caution and scrutiny around trade finance from regulatory bodies across the globe – from London to Hong Kong, Singapore and New York.” 
Humphrey says regulators are showing heightened attention to banks’ financial crime risk assessments, the threats associated with dual-use goods, and the potential for fraud. 
“​​This shift has been mirrored by risk managers inside banks, who have started to question whether they have enough resources to reliably avoid a situation of the likes of Hin Leong or Greensill,” she says. 
Many lenders have scaled back their exposure to trade finance, particularly at the smaller end of the market, while others have exited entirely. 
The paper recommends that firms carry out thorough due diligence across their entire supply chains, arguing that doing so will boost their reputation for good practice among stakeholders, as well as reduce their risk of exposure to illicit activity. 
Where necessary, enhanced due diligence – such as establishing a client’s source of wealth or funds – is also essential in assessing the risk associated with a particular customer, the paper says. Analysis of a client’s transactional history can help identify “nefarious activity” if transactions do not match expected volumes. 
Technology should be used to map relationships between individuals and entities, scrutinise corporate structures, and improve verification of identity documents, Themis adds.

The person pleaded guilty to VAT fraud and went to prison.HSBC also failed to detect a customer imprisoned for smuggling cigarettes into the UK and ordered to pay £1.2m by the HMRC tax office, where the bank missed ""a sustained period of unusual activity,"" the FCA said.In a statement, an HSBC said: ""We are pleased to resolve this matter, which relates to HSBC's legacy anti-money laundering systems and controls in the UK.""HSBC is deeply committed to combating financial crime and protecting the integrity of the global financial system.""It is not the first time HSBC has been fined for lax money laundering controls. In 2012, it paid $1.9bn (£1.4bn) after an investigation by the US Department of Justice for failing to prevent laundering by Mexican drug cartels. The bank agreed to be monitored by US regulators for five years.The FCA said its fine did not relate to the US action.On Monday, banking rival NatWest was fined £265m after admitting it failed to prevent money-laundering of nearly £400m by one firm.A gold trading firm suspected of money-laundering deposited £700,000 in cash into one NatWest branch in black bin bags.NatWest said it deeply regrets failing to monitor the customer properly.More on this storyNatWest fined £265m after bin bags of cash laundered13 December 2021Banking giant HSBC sees profit more than double2 August 2021Related TopicsUK bankingFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA)HSBCNatWest GroupBankingMoney launderingTop StoriesLive. Shallow grave provides more evidence of atrocities near KyivElon Musk snaps up $3bn Twitter stakePublished2 hours agoHungary's PM criticises Zelensky as he wins votePublished16 minutes agoFeatures'My little son hides bread, afraid there won't be food'My life before the war in Ukraine.

But some employees are walking away from name-brand institutions in search of more risk, and potentially, more reward.JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are among the firms with dedicated groups for cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology. JPMorgan has one of the largest crypto teams, with more than 200 employees working in its Onyx division. The JPM Coin digital currency is being used commercially to send payments around the world.Umar Farooq, the CEO of Onyx by JPMorgan, said the team has to worry about compliance and protecting the bank's brand and often moves slower than your average crypto start-up. But when products are launched, they reach ""a scale that a fintech can only dream of.""""There aren't many places where you can roll out a new platform and that platform can go from literally nothing to transacting a billion dollars of trade a day in a few months,"" Farooq told CNBC. ""That sort of scale can only be possible when you operate at a company like JPMorgan Chase. The upside of that scale is way more important than whatever downsides might exist by virtue of more regulations or controls.""When it comes to hiring, Farooq said it's a mix of current JPMorgan employees and competing for talent with start-ups and bigger tech companies. From first-year analysts to senior management and managing directors, there's a greater interest in making the move to crypto, he said.A 'Wall St' sign is seen above two 'One Way' signs in New York.Lucas Jackson | ReutersFinancial services firms added three times as many crypto jobs last year than in 2015, according to recent data from LinkedIn. In the first half of 2021, that pace jumped by 40%. Banks on a crypto hiring spree included Deutsche Bank, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Capital One, Barclays, Credit Suisse, UBS, Bank of America and BNY Mellon.The crypto boom on Wall Street coincides with more funding and hiring in the start-up world. Crypto and blockchain companies raised a record $25 billion last year, an eightfold increase from a year earlier, according to CB Insights data.Farooq said that even with the start-up boom, JPMorgan has seen ""limited attrition."" Those leaving have been people ""wanting to start their own company versus wanting to leave and go do something similar.""However, JPMorgan did lose one of its highest-profile crypto deputies last year. Christine Moy is on garden leave after departing her role as managing director and global head of crypto and metaverse at Onyx. She has yet to announce her next move.""After over a half-decade laying the foundations for blockchain-based infrastructure across financial markets and cross-border payments, creating new businesses that have already scaled into the $USD billions at J.P. Morgan, I am looking to challenge myself further by finding new opportunities to create value and drive impact for the Web3/crypto ecosystem from a new angle,"" Moy told CNBC in an email.Leaving Wall StreetOther top crypto executives who left Wall Street recently expressed some frustration at how long it takes to get projects moving within a large financial institution.Mary Catherine Lader, chief operating officer at Uniswap Labs, left her job as a managing director at BlackRock last year. Her foray into crypto started as a side project within the asset management company.""It certainly wasn't my primary job,"" Lader said. ""It was kind of a hobby, as it is for so many people on Wall Street, and it definitely wasn't something that at the time I was thinking about, because it was early stages of adoption.""VIDEO18:3818:38Uniswap's Mary-Catherine Lader explains why she left BlackRock for cryptoCrypto WorldAt Uniswap, Lader is now working on an emerging decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. She said she couldn't pass up the opportunity to work on the next wave of innovation.""This technology is so critical to the future of finance that it didn't feel like a risk at all,"" Lader said. ""I was sad to leave the people I had loved working with for many years. I have tremendous respect for the firm, but it didn't feel like a risk. That's a great thing about where we are in Web3.""Justin Schmidt, former head of digital asset markets at Goldman Sachs, made a similar career change last year. He joined institutional crypto trading platform Talos and described the risk in a similar way, calling the decision ""multidimensional.""""Inherently, you're taking a brand risk — Goldman is one of the storied institutions of Wall Street,"" Schmidt said. ""You are also taking a risk by staying someplace more traditional, and I very firmly believe that this is a generational change and there's a generational opportunity here.""Cryptocurrency start-ups and banks describe a shift in the hunt for top talent. Many are looking beyond top candidates with MBAs, and instead considering those with less conventional resumes. Lader and Schmidt said some of their best crypto hires have been self-taught engineers or crypto influencers they first interacted with on Twitter.""I constantly am meeting people who are 23 years old, who are as smart about markets as people I worked with on Wall Street for years,"" Lader said. ""People who frankly had no interest in financial services, who would never really explore or consider working on Wall Street, are excited to work at UniSwap Labs and companies like us.""More In Crypto Worldwatch nowVIDEO11:22How fast-moving crypto start-ups lured top talent from Wall Street: CNBC Crypto WorldKate Rooneywatch nowVIDEO18:38Uniswap's Mary-Catherine Lader explains why she left BlackRock for cryptoKate Rooneywatch nowVIDEO09:24Defiance ETFs' Sylvia Jablonski remains 'completely bullish' on bitcoin: CNBC Crypto WorldTanaya MacheelRead MoreSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

FCA secures criminal conviction of NatWest for money laundering breaches
Posted on 8 October 2021


















On 7 October at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, NatWest entered guilty pleas to three counts of failure to prevent money laundering under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (MLR 2007). The charges were brought by the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'). The bank admitted it failed to comply with regulation 8(1) between 7 November 2013 until 23 June 2016, and regulations 8(3) and 14(1) between 8 November 2012 and 23 June 2016, in relation to the accounts of a UK incorporated customer.
The UK customer was Yorkshire-based gold dealership Fowler Oldfield Ltd. Between 7 November 2013 and 23 June 2016, Flower Oldfield deposited £365 million into its NatWest accounts, £264 million of which was in cash. Flower Oldfield subsequently shut down after police raided their premises in 2016.
The case has been sent to Southwark Crown Court for sentencing and the FCA intends to recommend a fine in the region of £340m.
Analysis
This case is noteworthy for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is the first criminal prosecution brought under the MLR 2007 by the FCA. It also confirms the FCA's decision and the wishes of its CEO to become a more  assertive, confident, decisive and agile regulator. This same sentiment was expressed by the FCA's Chairman Charles Randall at the FCA's Annual Public Meeting, which took place on the 28 September, where he stated that the regulator was undertaking a broad programme of change to become a more proactive and assertive regulator. 
The FCA's decision to pursue a criminal prosecution where a civil resolution was available should alert firms to how committed the regulator is to making full use of its powers in cases of tackling wrongdoing. Having already suffered criticism that it was slow to act in previous cases, the FCA has signalled that it will take a strict approach with offending parties in the future. The regulations under which NatWest was prosecuted do not require proof that money laundering has taken place.
The case serves as a reminder of the need for firms to have adequate procedures in place to prevent money laundering, particularly as it relates to ongoing monitoring of customer relationships.  At the outset of its relationship with Fowler Oldfield, it was agreed that NatWest would not handle cash deposits for the dealership, but across the relevant period it nevertheless accepted £264 million in cash. Indeed on one single day the dealership deposited £1.8 million in cash with the bank.
""Adequate risk-based due diligence and monitoring of client relationships must be an ongoing exercise for corporate entities who wish to safeguard themselves in the face of closer regulatory scrutiny and what promises to be an aggressive prosecutorial landscape going forward. Banks and other regulated firms must ensure that their systems are fit for purpose"" - Johanna Walsh, Partner in the White Collar Crime & Investigations Group

    NatWest Pleads Guilty to Anti-Money-Laundering Charges
  
The guilty plea is the first criminal prosecution under money-laundering regulations that went into effect in 2007, according to a U.K.’s financial regulator

 















The criminal charges stemmed from operational weaknesses in NatWest’s anti-money-laundering protections, the bank said.

A subsidiary of










            NatWest Group


      PLC pleaded guilty in the U.K. on Thursday to charges that it violated regulations requiring financial institutions to maintain adequate anti-money-laundering systems and controls.
The guilty plea is the first criminal prosecution under money-laundering regulations that went into effect in 2007, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority said.

The criminal charges, brought by the FCA, stemmed from operational weaknesses in the U.K. bank’s anti-money-laundering protections between 2012 and 2016 that caused it to fail to adequately monitor the accounts of an unnamed U.K. incorporated customer, NatWest said.
The case has been sent to the Southwark Crown Court in London for sentencing, the FCA said Thursday. NatWest said the sentencing was expected to be in four to eight weeks, and that it would make a provision in the company’s third-quarter financial statements in anticipation of a potential fine being imposed. The statements are due to be published on Oct. 29.

NatWest said it had cooperated fully with the FCA since the beginning of the investigation.
“We deeply regret that NatWest failed to adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016. NatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties,” NatWest Chief Executive









      
      Alison Rose



      said.
The FCA on Thursday said that no individuals would be charged as part of the proceedings against the bank.
Based on statements made at court, NatWest is likely to be fined between £174 million and £348 million (a range of about $237 million to $474 million in U.S. dollars), according to S&P Global Ratings. The credit rating firm said it expected NatWest’s franchise and daily business activities wouldn’t be materially affected by the fine.
The case demonstrates the challenges faced by large banks in implementing robust prevention and detection processes, and verifying that these controls are deployed effectively across the institution, S&P added.
NatWest has spent nearly £700 million to strengthen its financial crime control systems over the last five years, and plans to invest another £1 billion in the next five years, according to the bank.

Wall Street had expected deliveries of 308,836 cars, according to Refinitiv data.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterTesla produced 305,407 vehicles from January to March, down from 305,840 the previous quarter.Tesla, the world's most valuable automaker, has navigated the pandemic and supply chain disruptions better than rivals and its new Shanghai factory has been driving growth.But a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in China has forced Tesla to temporarily suspend production at the Shanghai factory for several days in March and April as the city locks down to test residents for the disease.  read more The deliveries were ""better than feared given supply chain issues,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, in a report.Tesla said it sold a total of 295,324 Model 3 sedans and Model Y sport utility vehicles, while it delivered 14,724 Model S luxury sedans and Model X premium SUVs.PRICE HIKESkyrocketing gas prices spurred by the Ukraine crisis is expected to fuel demand for electric cars, but lack of inventory and higher vehicle prices would weigh on sales, analysts said.Tesla in March raised prices in China and the United States after Musk said the U.S. electric carmaker was facing significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.""Impressive (deliveries) given all the headwinds,"" Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, said, adding he expected Tesla to continue outperforming other automakers in sales growth.Toyota and GM, Hyundai Motor on Friday reported lower first-quarter U.S. sales than a year earlier.  read more Musk said in October that Shanghai had surpassed its Fremont, California factory - the company's first plant - in output. The two factories are critical for Tesla's goal to boost deliveries by 50% this year, as production at its new factories are expected to ramp up slowly in their first year.Tesla started delivering vehicles made at its factory in Gruenheide, Germany, in March and deliveries of cars made at its plant in Austin, Texas, were to begin in the near future.The company's stock soared after Tesla this week revealed plans to seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split.  read more  Tesla shares have risen about 3% so far this year, while GM and Ford shares have declined.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterReporting by Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco, Akash Sriram, Akriti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Alistair Bell, Diane Craft and Richard ChangOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Auto FileSubscribe to our auto newsletter to get the latest news that are driving the global automotive industry.Sign upDaily BriefingSubscribe to our newsletter to get all the news you need to start your day.Sign upSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout ReutersCareersReuters News AgencyBrand Attribution GuidelinesReuters LeadershipReuters Fact CheckReuters Diversity ReportStay InformedDownload the AppNewslettersInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

    Two-Year Treasury Yield Climbs Above 10-Year Again
  
Bond yields move higher as March employment report shows wages continue to rise

 















Labor Department data show that the economy added 431,000 jobs in March.

          Updated April 1, 2022 3:58 pm ET
        











Yields on U.S. government bonds climbed Friday, aided by a strong jobs report, after a burst of quarter-end buying had driven them lower in recent sessions.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.374%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 2.324% Thursday.
 Short-term Treasury yields rose more than longer-term yields, reflecting expectations that the Fed could start raising its benchmark federal-funds rate in half-percentage-point increments in coming meetings in an effort to tame inflation.
The two-year yield settled at 2.430%, compared with 2.284% Thursday. It was the first time the two-year yield closed above the 10-year yield since 2019, a sign investors think the Fed could start cutting rates in response to slowing economic growth not long after it has finished raising them.


Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed in the overnight session. Shorter-term yields, especially, then took another leg upward after data from the Labor Department showed that the economy added 431,000 jobs in March and that average hourly earnings increased 0.4% from the previous month.
Bond investors have been particularly focused on wage gains, which can be a long-term driver of overall inflation. The data for March showed that wages are still climbing at a rapid clip, returning to trend after they were reported to be nearly flat in the previous data release.
“Overall, this is an extremely consensus payrolls report that will keep the Fed on track” to raise rates by half a percentage point at its May meeting, Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.
Friday’s trading suggested that a tough period for bond investors may not be over after they got a reprieve in recent sessions—with the 10-year yield declining after reaching 2.5% in intraday trading on March 25.
Despite the last-minute rally, bonds still suffered their worst quarter in four decades, thanks to continued high inflation and escalating expectations for how much the Fed could tighten monetary policy over the next two years.
The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate bond index—largely U.S. Treasurys, highly rated corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities—returned minus 5.9% over the first three months of the year, its biggest quarterly loss since 1980.











          An inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve has been seen as a recession warning sign for decades, and it looks like it’s about to light up again. WSJ’s Dion Rabouin explains why an inverted yield curve can be so reliable in predicting recession and why market watchers are talking about it now. Illustration: Ryan Trefes
