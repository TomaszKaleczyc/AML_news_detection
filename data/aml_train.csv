After pleading guilty to violating provisions of anti-money laundering rules, U.K. bank National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) was hit with a £264.8-million fine.
The sanctions follow the first criminal prosecution for money laundering failings by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 







NatWest pleaded guilty and was convicted for three offences of failing to comply with money laundering regulations.
According to the FCA, the charges stemmed from NatWest’s failure to properly monitor the activity of jewellery business Fowler Oldfield between November 2012 to June 2016.
During that time, the company deposited approximately £365 million with the bank, including £264 million in cash.
“Some of the bank’s employees, who were responsible for handling these cash deposits, reported their suspicions to bank staff responsible for investigating suspected money laundering, however no appropriate action was ever taken,” the FCA said.
Following an investigation by West Yorkshire Police, 11 people pleaded guilty to charges relating to the cash deposits and three cash couriers were charged. Another 13 people are awaiting trial in the case. The trial is set for April 2022.
Justice Cockerill, the sentencing judge at Southwark Crown Court, said that while the bank was “in no way complicit” in the money laundering, it was “functionally vital.”
“Without the bank — and without the bank’s failures — the money could not be effectively laundered,” the judge said.
Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said NatWest was responsible for “a catalogue of failures” in how it scrutinised suspicious transactions.
“Combined with serious systems failures, like the treatment of cash deposits as cheques, these failures created an open door for money laundering,” he said in a release.
“We deeply regret that we failed to adequately monitor one of our customers between 2012 and 2016 for the purpose of preventing money laundering,” NatWest CEO Alison Rose said in a statement.
“While today’s hearing brings an end to this case, we will continue to invest significant resources in the ongoing fight against financial crime.”

(AP Photo/Hussein Malla, File)BEIRUT (AP) — Authorities in three European countries have frozen more than $130 million in assets linked to an investigation into money laundering in Lebanon, a European Union agency said Monday.The measures taken by officials in France, Germany and Luxembourg come as Lebanon grapples with a devastating economic crisis and coincide with domestic and European investigations of its longtime central bank governor, Riad Salameh. The crisis, which started in October 2019, is rooted in decades of corruption and mismanagement and has continued with no serious steps by the country’s political class to work for a solution.The European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, or Eurojust, said the investigation targets five suspects accused of money laundering. It did not identify the five, adding that they are suspected of embezzling public funds in Lebanon amounting to more than $330 million and 5 million euros ($5.5 million) respectively, between 2002 and 2021.ADVERTISEMENTIt said the assets that were frozen on Friday amount to 120 million euros ($131.6 million).It was not immediately clear if the case is linked to the investigation of Salameh, who was charged by a Lebanese judge earlier this month with illegal enrichment and money laundering. Salameh’s brother, Raja, has been under arrest since March 17, over corruption charges.BusinessNew Twitter biggie Musk may have thoughts on edit buttonWhite House to extend student loan pause through AugustAmazon's first US union overcomes hurdles, faces new onesEuropean Union proposes Russian coal ban in new sanctionsThe Salameh brothers’ assets have been frozen in Lebanon under an order from a judge in the Lebanese money laundering case. A Lebanese judge had said that Riad Salameh had used his brother to buy real-estate in France worth nearly $12 million.There have also been reports that a brokerage firm, Forry Associates Ltd., owned by Raja Salameh, was hired by the central bank to handle government bond sales in which the firm received $330 million in commissions. The governor, who has denied all charges of corruption, calling them politicized, said last November that “not a single penny of public money” was used to pay Forry Associates Ltd.A Eurojust spokesperson contacted by The Associated Press refused to name the people targeted saying: “We can never give information on suspects.”Eurojust said the suspects in the main investigation “are assumed to be innocent until they have been proven guilty, according to law.”It said judicial authorities in Germany seized assets worth more than 35 million euros ($38.4 million). French authorities seized assets worth at least 18.2 million euros ($20 million) and bank accounts worth 46 million euros ($50.5 million) in Monaco. They also seized a building in Brussels worth 7 million euros ($7.7 million).In Luxembourg, approximately 11 million euros ($12 million) were seized across several bank accounts, it said.ADVERTISEMENTA Lebanese banker said the Eurojust statement “did not give any hint, or proof or a fact that the assets frozen are linked or related in any way into Forry’s operations,” although he noted the numbers involved were similar. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.Riad Salameh, who has not been arrested, has steered Lebanese finances since 1993, through post-war recovery and bouts of unrest. He was once praised as the guardian of Lebanon’s financial stability but has drawn increasing scrutiny since the meltdown started in 2019. He is also being investigated in several European nations, including Switzerland and France, for potential money laundering and embezzlement.AP NEWSTop StoriesVideoContact UsAccessibility StatementCookie SettingsDownload AP NEWSConnect with the definitive source for global and local newsMore from APap.orgAP InsightsAP Definitive Source BlogAP Images SpotlightAP ExploreAP BooksFollow APThe Associated PressAboutContactCustomer SupportCareersTerms & ConditionsPrivacyAll contents © copyright 2022 The Associated Press.

Austrac launches civil proceedings over alleged AML failings at Crown

1st March 2022
 | By Robert Fletcher
			

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac), a government-operated national financial intelligence agency, has commenced civil penalty proceedings against Crown Resorts over allegations of “serious and systemic” anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) failings.

Legal action follows compliance work with the casino sector, which Austrac said led to a number of detailed enforcement investigations including into compliance of the Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth properties.
Austrac’s allegations include that the two properties failed to appropriately assess the money laundering and terrorism financing risks they faced, including the likelihood and impact of those risks, and to identify and respond to changes in risk over time.
Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth were also found to have not included in their AML/CTF programs appropriate risk-based systems and controls to mitigate and manage the risks to Crown.
Austrac also said the properties did not establish an appropriate framework for board and senior management oversight of the AML/CTF programs, nor did they have a transaction monitoring program to help identify suspicious activity that was risk-based or appropriate to the nature, size and complexity of Crown.
Other alleged failings included that the properties did not have an appropriate enhanced customer due diligence program to carry out additional checks on higher risk customers, nor did they conduct appropriate ongoing customer due diligence on a players who presented higher money laundering risks.
“Austrac’s investigation identified poor governance, risk management and failures to have and maintain a compliant AML/CTF program detailing how Crown would identify, mitigate and manage the risk of their products and services being misused for money laundering or terrorism financing,” Austrac chief executive Nicole Rose said.
“They also failed to carry out appropriate ongoing customer due diligence including on some very high-risk customers. This led to widespread and serious non-compliance over a number of years..
“Austrac has taken this strong action to achieve enduring change and ensure that Crown will fully meet their obligations to protect themselves and Australia’s financial system from criminal activity.”
Rose also said the absence of appropriate controls and processes meant Crown was unable to appropriately manage high risk customers, which in turn allowed the movement of money in non-transparent ways, making Crown vulnerable to criminal exploitation.
“This is an important reminder to all casinos in Australia that they must have a strong anti-money laundering program in place to protect their business and the community from serious and organised crime,” Rose said.
Austrac said it would not provide further comment on the action or details provided in the court documents now the matter is before the court, adding that whether a civil penalty order is made, and what this could amount, are matters for the court.
Responding to the case, Crown said it had developed a comprehensive remediation plan intended to position the group as a “leader” in the industry in its approach to governance, compliance, responsible gaming and the management of financial crime risk.
These actions included establishing a comprehensive Financial Crime & Compliance Change Program and implementing new controls to manage the risk of financial crime, including a revised Joint AML/CTF program.
Other activity included introducing improved controls to prevent and detect money laundering through Crown’s bank accounts and reduced limits for cash deposits at its casinos, as well as increasing its Financial Crime and Compliance resourcing and capability.
Crown also noted it had invested in automation, specifically a new automated transaction monitoring system and digitised tool to allow electronic submission and investigation of unusual activity reports, while a forensic audit and controls assessment of Crown’s patron bank accounts was carried out by an independent consultant.
“The plan is underpinned by an uplifted organisational culture,” Crown said. “Crown recognises the importance of complying with its financial crime obligations and has overhauled its approach to managing financial crime risk.”
Rose acknowledged these efforts, saying: “Crown is taking steps towards improving its systems, processes and resourcing however there is further work to do and Austrac will continue to work closely with Crown to address ongoing compliance concerns.”
Crown has faced a number of regulatory issues in recent times. In October last year, Crown was found to be “unsuitable” to operate Crown Melbourne in in Victoria following an investigation by the state’s Royal Commission. 
Crown did not lose its licence, due to the potential economic repercussions for Victoria, but was ordered to adhere to special measures, including 33 recommendations made by the Commission.
This investigation came as a result of the Bergin Inquiry in New South Wales, which was launched in August 2019. 
The inquiry assessed Crown’s eligibility to receive a casino licence in Sydney, ultimately deeming it “unsuitable”. However, it said it may still be permitted to operate the casino following implementation of its reforms.
Meanwhile, Austrac said that enforcement investigations into SkyCity Adelaide and the Star Entertainment, announced in June of last year, continue. Star and SkyCity, along with Crown, received notice of the allegations, while the National Bank of Australia (NAB) was also contacted by Austrac.
At the time, Austrac said the matter was related to “serious non-compliance” with the Australian Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Rules Instrument 2007 (AML/CTF Rules).

We are closely following developments in Pakistan. We respect and support Pakistan's constitutional process and the rule of law,"" a US State Department spokesperson told ANI.The Pakistan Prime Minister reiterated his claims of 'foreign conspiracy' in the country, saying that a foreign nation is trying to oust him over the ""independent"" foreign policy choices made by him.Addressing the people of Pakistan, ahead of the no-confidence motion, Imran claimed a foreign nation sent a message that Imran Khan needs to be removed else the country will suffer consequences.""The United States"", Imran Khan said in a slip of the tongue and then stated that ""a foreign country"" had sent a ""threatening memo"" which was against the Pakistani nation.""On March 8 or before that on March 7, the US sent us a...not the US but a foreign country sent us a message. The reason why I am talking about this...for an independent country to receive such a message... this is against me and the country,"" he said.Imran Khan said the memo was against him, not against the government.

""Now that we have a majority, there is no safe passage (for Imran Khan), there is no face-saving way and there is no backdoor,"" he said.The PPP chairman suggested that there is only one ""honourable"" way out for Imran Khan: to resign in a bid to end the political crisis in the country.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Also ReadWhy Has No Pakistani PM Ever Completed A Full Term? | 'Hot Mic' with Nidhi RazdanImran Khan Paying Price For Being ""Disobedient"" To US: RussiaReady To Hold General Elections If Required: Pakistan Election CommissionTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

REUTERS/Arnd WIegmannRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterZURICH, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse faced charges in a Swiss court on Monday of allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros, some of it stuffed into suitcases.In the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland, Swiss prosecutors are seeking around 42.4 million Swiss francs ($45.86 million) in compensation from Credit Suisse (CSGN.S).They say the country's second-biggest bank and one of its former relationship managers did not take all necessary steps to prevent the alleged drug traffickers from hiding and laundering cash between 2004 and 2008.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegister""Credit Suisse unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it and is convinced that its former employee is innocent,"" the bank said in a statement to Reuters. It added it would ""defend itself vigorously in court"".The case has attracted intense interest in Switzerland, where it is seen as a test for prosecutors taking a potentially tougher stance against the country's banks.The indictment runs to more than 500 pages, and centres on relationships that Credit Suisse and its ex-employee had with former Bulgarian wrestler Evelin Banev and multiple associates, two of whom are charged in the case. A second indictment in the case charges a former relationship manager at Julius Baer with facilitating money laundering.A legal representative for the ex-Credit Suisse employee, who cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, said the case was unjustified and his client denied wrongdoing.That banker would start testifying on Wednesday or Thursday, a preliminary court schedule showed.A lawyer for the two alleged gang members, who face charges of multiple counts of misappropriation, fraud and forgery of documents in the Swiss federal court but cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, declined to comment. A lawyer for the former relationship manager at Julius Baer did not respond to requests for comment.Banev, who does not face charges in Switzerland, was convicted of drug trafficking in Italy in 2017 and then in Bulgaria in 2018 for money laundering.He vanished, but was arrested in September in Ukraine.Bulgarian prosecutors are seeking his extradition to face charges of setting up an organised criminal group for money laundering, while Romania seeks him for setting up a group for drug trafficking, Interpol's red list of wanted persons shows.Banev's legal representative had no immediate comment.Julius Baer (BAER.S), which is not facing charges, declined to comment on the case.CASH IN CASESThe former Credit Suisse employee brought at least one Bulgarian customer, who was an associate of Banev, with her when she joined Credit Suisse in 2004, prosecutors allege in the indictment.The customer, who was later shot dead as he left a restaurant with his wife in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2005, had begun placing suitcases full of cash in a safe deposit box at Credit Suisse, the indictment says.Prosecutors allege the gang used a practice known as smurfing, whereby a large sum of money is broken down into smaller amounts that are below the anti-money laundering alert threshold, to launder money, putting millions of euros in small-value bills into safety deposit boxes and later transferring them into accounts.The defendants said this was standard practice at the time the deposits were made, although Swiss private banks have since adopted much tougher anti-money laundering know-your-client checks after international pressure.The prosecutors allege the former relationship manager, who left Credit Suisse in 2010 after being detained for two weeks by police in 2009, helped conceal the criminal origins of money for the clients by carrying out more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions, including 43 million francs in cash.""Our client is being unfairly accused, because Swiss law requires that a person be implicated in order to condemn a bank,"" attorneys at law firm MANGEAT LLC, representing the ex-employee, told Reuters. ""She is innocent, outraged by the accusations. We will plead for her full and complete acquittal.""Credit Suisse disputes the illegal origin of the money, a source familiar with its thinking told Reuters, saying that Banev and his circle operated legitimate businesses in construction, leasing and hotels.The Swiss bank, which the indictment says considered Bulgaria as a high-risk country at the time, plans to draw attention to calls made by its compliance department to Swiss prosecutors after Banev was temporarily arrested in Bulgaria in April 2007, the source added.Credit Suisse is hoping that the court will view that its compliance department's move was a sign of the bank taking its anti-money laundering obligations seriously and of cooperating with prosecutors in the matter.In June 2007, the prosecutors asked Credit Suisse for information on accounts held by Banev and his associates in response to a request from Bulgaria, the source added.Noticing a series of withdrawals, the bank's compliance department asked prosecutors whether to freeze the accounts, but was told not to in order to avoid tipping the clients off, according to the source.By the time prosecutors gave Credit Suisse the go-ahead, much of the money had been withdrawn.The prosecutors' office declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was in the hands of the court.The second indictment filed by federal prosecutors against the former relationship manager at Julius Baer, which is being tried in the same court case, alleges some of the funds were transferred to another Swiss bank.The former relationship manager, who left a few months after the transfers took place, is charged with facilitating money laundering.Julius Baer had refused to accept a suitcase filled with cash from the defendants, the indictment says.($1 = 0.9245 Swiss francs)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterReporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Silke Koltrowitz; Additional reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova; Editing by Alexander Smith and Barbara LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Global InvestorSign up to our investor newsletter to get the latest news and trends in global financial markets.Sign upDaily BriefingSubscribe to our newsletter to get all the news you need to start your day.Sign upSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout ReutersCareersReuters News AgencyBrand Attribution GuidelinesReuters LeadershipReuters Fact CheckReuters Diversity ReportStay InformedDownload the AppNewslettersInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

Opinion: Why gold and platinum are a window into the stock market’s future and what investors can expect

COMP

 
                    -2.23%



























The stock market’s prospects for the next 12 months are only modestly positive. That’s the conclusion of a market-timing model based on the ratio of gold’s price 
        GC00,
        -0.41%
       to platinum’s 
        PL00,
        -2.05%.
       You might think it’s good news that equities’ 12-month potential is as promising now as it was in early 2021. But, in fact, most stocks have struggled since then. A relatively small number of large-cap stocks have propelled the S&P 500 
        SPX,
        -1.27%
       higher, and the Russell 2000 index 
        RUT,
        -2.30%
       is 9.2% lower than where it stood when my early-2021 column on this gold-platinum ratio was published. The Nasdaq Composite Index 
        COMP,
        -2.23%
       is just 1.8% higher while the Russell Micro-Cap Index  is 14.7% lower. (Data, courtesy of FactSet, are through Mar. 28.)

The discovery of the gold-platinum ratio’s market-timing potential traces to a 2019 study in the Journal of Financial Economics. It showed that a rising gold-platinum ratio forecasts higher stock market returns over the subsequent 12 months, and vice versa. Entitled “Gold, Platinum and Expected Stock Returns,” its authors are Darien Huang, a former finance professor at Cornell University, and Mete Kilic, a finance professor at the University of Southern California. The chart below plots this gold-platinum ratio over the last 20 years. Notice that the ratio declined for many years prior to and including the 2008 financial crisis, correctly predicting less upside potential for the stock market. Since 2008, in contrast, the ratio has for the most part steadily risen — as has the stock market.









During the COVID pandemic of the past two years the ratio has been highly volatile: It spiked in the wake of the market’s waterfall decline in March 2020, anticipating the market’s huge potential over the subsequent 12 months. Since then it fell, rose again, and over the past couple of months has fallen back. The ratio works, according to the professors, because platinum and gold respond to different factors. While platinum primarily reflects changes in industrial demand, gold responds both to that demand as well as investors’ desire to hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainty. By focusing on the ratio of gold’s price to platinum’s, you zero in on that portion of gold’s price that is a hedge against uncertainty. Since the stock market’s expected return is compensation for uncertainty and risk, this ratio should be particularly valuable to market timers. That’s exactly what the professors found. Since 1975, the gold-platinum ratio has had a significantly better track record predicting the market’s subsequent 12-month return than nine other well-known indicators that other researchers previously found to have predictive ability — including, prominently, the Cyclically-Adjusted PE Ratio, or CAPE, made famous by Yale University (and Nobel laureate) Robert Shiller.The ‘war puzzle‘ You might find it surprising that the gold-platinum ratio has fallen in recent months, which suggests that risk has declined. Yet in February Russia invaded Ukraine and, according to some, the conflict could lead to World War III. That certainly seems like the very definition of heightened risk. In fact, however, the gold-platinum ratio’s decline in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is not that unexpected. In academic circles it’s been known for some time that the stock market tends to experience below-average volatility during wars and military conflicts — a pattern known as the “war puzzle.” According to a study that the National Bureau of Economic Research began circulating a couple of weeks ago, stock market volatility has been “33 percent lower during major wars and periods of conflict since 1921.” The study, “Stock Volatility and the War Puzzle,” was conducted by Gustavo Cortes, a finance professor at the University of Florida; Angela Vossmeyer, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College, and Marc Weidenmier, a research associate at Chapman College. They at least partially solved the puzzle, finding that increased defense spending during wars and military conflicts leads corporate profits to become more predictable. That in turn translates to lower stock market volatility and risk. Regardless of whether this solves the “war puzzle,” the message of the gold-platinum based indicator with a good market-timing record is that the stock market’s potential over the next 12 months is only moderately positive.

Oil jumps more than 5% on Russia tensions
Fallout from war in Ukraine could cut global economic growth by ""over 1% point"" in first year after invasion, says OECD 

By AFP 

March 17, 2022 










The price of benchmark oil contract, Brent North Sea crude, jumped more than 5% to back above $100 per barrel after Russia rejected a ruling from the UN's court to suspend its Ukraine offensive. Photo: AFP  LONDON: Oil prices soared Thursday on tensions surrounding key producer Russia, as equities diverged with traders tracking also interest rate decisions and China's pledge to support volatile markets.The price of benchmark oil contract, Brent North Sea crude, jumped more than 5% to back above $100 per barrel after Russia rejected a ruling from the UN's top court to suspend its Ukraine offensive.




""Russia's invasion is still dictating price action... given the country's global importance in terms of supply,"" Interactive Investor analyst Victoria Scholar told AFP.The fallout from the war in Ukraine could cut global economic growth by ""over 1% point"" in the first year after the invasion, the OECD grouping of developed economies said in a report.The impact ""if sustained"" would produce ""a deep recession in Russia"" and further increase global consumer price inflation by approximately 2.5% points, it added.The warning came as Russia's finance ministry said it had carried out interest payments on two foreign bonds, avoiding default for now after it was hit by unprecedented Western sanctions over Ukraine.Central banksCentral banks were also in focus with the Bank of England expected to announce a third straight interest rate rise to combat decades-high UK inflation.The Bank of England (BoE) gives its latest rate decision at 1200 GMT, a day after the Federal Reserve lifted US borrowing costs to tackle soaring prices.""The global economy faces elevated levels of inflation because of various factors, including from surging energy and commodity prices,"" noted Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarkets.""While the Fed has just started its hiking cycle, the BoE is well on the way, having raised interest rates in its previous two meetings.""In Asia, Hong Kong's main stocks index closed with another massive gain, as investors pile back in after China's pledge to support markets.The Hang Seng surged 7%, a day after a 9% jump.Another blistering surge in tech firms helped Hong Kong extend its recovery from the recent rout, while traders also cheered soothing comments on the US economy by the Fed after it lifted interest rates.China's top economic official has vowed measures to support beaten-down markets and indicated that a debilitating crackdown on the technology sector was nearing its end.""The statement addressed so many issues on various fronts, which is really rare,"" said Ding Shuang at Standard Chartered.""Selloffs tended to be self-fulfilling partly because of the lack of response from the government,"" but part of the government's aim is likely to break that inertia and stabilise expectations, he added.Key figures around 1045 GMTBrent North Sea crude: UP 5.0% at $102.95 per barrelWest Texas Intermediate: UP 4.5% at $99.27 per barrelLondon - FTSE 100: UP 0.1% at 7,296.04 pointsFrankfurt - DAX: DOWN 0.6% at 14,352.04Paris - CAC 40: FLAT at 6,588.75EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.3% at 3,877.75Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 7.0% at 21,501.23 (close)Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 3.5% at 26,652.88 (close)Shanghai - Composite: UP 1.4% at 3,215.04 (close)New York - DOW: UP 1.6% at 34,063.10 (close)Euro/dollar: UP at $1.1039 from $1.1038 late WednesdayPound/dollar: UP at $1.3180 from $1.3148Euro/pound: DOWN at 83.75 pence from 83.90 penceDollar/yen: DOWN at 118.59 yen from 118.73 yen

We like all those companies. They are all valuable entities and if there is regulatory approval to increase the holdings we will be happy to do so. But I am not too sure about what the regulatory process. We are also happy to pare it down if the approvals don't come but the intent is to increase,"" Jadishan said.AFPHDFC CEO Keki Mistry said he is confident that the RBI will give an approval for the bank to hold stake in these subsidiaries.RelatedChairman Deepak Parekh says HDFC found a home within the familyMortgage lender HDFC announces merger with HDFC bankHDFC Bank merger to create entity twice the size of ICICI Bank: S&PNearly 8 years ago, a RBI notification had triggered possible HDFC-HDFC Bank merger talksHDFC Bank will hold stakes in the subsidiary companies of HDFC including large businesses like mutual fund, life and general insurance post the merger of HDFC with itself but will comply with the regulatory guidelines on the same CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan said.

""Subsidiaries will remain subsidiaries of the bank. We like all those companies. They are all valuable entities and if there is regulatory approval to increase the holdings we will be happy to do so. But I am not too sure about what the regulatory process. We are also happy to pare it down if the approvals don't come but the intent is to increase,"" Jadishan said.

HDFC and HDFC Bank have written to RBI to transfer the stake of the subsidiaries from the housing finance company to the bank. HDFC CEO Keki Mistry said he is confident that the RBI will give an approval for the bank to hold stake in these subsidiaries.

""To my mind the RBI should give us the approval for the bank to hold investments in HDFC Life, HDFC AMC and the other subsidiaries the way similar exemptions are given to other banks which hold insurance companies so we are hopeful of getting that approval. We would like to increase our stake in HDFC Life if possible to 50% so that it remains a subsidiary of the bank,"" Mistry said.

HDFC holds 48% in HDFC Life, 53% in HDFC Asset Management Co, the mutual fund arm and 51% in HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co Ltd. There are no restrictions on a bank holding stake in the mutual fund business, but RBI has certain restrictions on banks holding stake in insurance companies.

“The RBI rule says either you have to have 50% or 30% and we are at 48% in our life insurance subsidiary. So, we have taken up the matter with RBI and we have to get a reply sometime sooner, permitting us to keep the stake as it is or they may tell us to buy that extra stake, which we can easily buy in the market to be compliant with the banking regulation of holding 50%. Ultimately we have to comply with RBI regulations and if there is a change we will accept the change. We have confirmed to the RBI that whatever rules they have for other banks on insurance companies the same will apply to us ,” said Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC.

Jagdishan said the bank will do what is complaint with the regulator. ""We have sought the approval to allow the holding in all the subsidiaries to the bank but if they were to say no we will comply with the regulation. We have no hesitation about that. In that case HDFC can monetise that or if possible we will try and integrate it within the bank,"" Jagdishan said.

2 brothers guilty of federal money laundering charges in Texas
In a prominent case, jurors found two of the three Yassine brothers guilty of the federal white collar crime of money laundering in October 2012.The Yassine family is well known for its downtown Austin, Texas, network of nightclubs that included bars Pure, Fuel, Malaia, Treasure Island Bar, Kiss & Fly, Roial, Hyde and Spill, owned and operated through its business Yassine Enterprises. Allegedly, they used their commercial venture to launder money from illegal drug deals. 
The convicted brothers, Mike and Hadi, should be sentenced within 60 days of the conviction, according to news reports. The federal penalty for money laundering is up to 10 years in prison, a fine up to $500,000 or both.
The bars have been closed by state authorities and the felony convictions will ensure that they are not able to get liquor licenses again for many years.
The third brother, Steve, was found not guilty of money laundering, but pleaded guilty a week later to a federal drug crime. He received a sentence of one year plus one day in prison, after which he will be deported to Ivory Coast where he has citizenship. 
The investigation into the scheme, undertaken by a network of federal, state and local agencies, took an amazing six years and culminated in March 2012 with the arrest of 10 people. Reportedly the suspects were charged with federal firearms, drug, and money laundering crimes.
The main witness against the brothers was a cousin who was an FBI informant. According to kxan.com, he testified that “the bars were used to launder thousands of dollars in drug money.” Your News Now Austin reports that evidence also included a recording of one of the brothers arranging to “launder up to $1 million.” An IRS special agent with expertise in bank records testified about the elaborate network of financial transactions.
 Money laundering 
Money laundering is a white collar crime wherein proceeds of illegal activity are put into the legitimate stream of money to make it harder to trace their origin. Most news stories about money laundering currently deal with money from illegal drug activity or related to allegations of terrorism.
Federal authorities are focused on untangling money laundering schemes, and have recently stepped up enforcement against financial institutions, specifically on whether banks are complying with legal requirements that they have internal systems in place to detect laundered money.
In addition to being a federal crime, money laundering is also a felony under the Texas Penal Code. The degree of the felony increases with the amount of money involved. The most severe punishment under Texas state law for money laundering is for a felony of the first degree, punishable by five to 99 years or life in prison, plus a possible fine up to $10,000. 
As the Yassine cases illustrate, punishment for money laundering can be severe. Anyone in Texas who is being investigated for or who has been charged with money laundering should consult with an experienced, knowledgeable criminal defense attorney to understand his or her legal rights and to mount a vigorous defense.

		Retired SJ Cop Sentenced for Millions in Insurance Fraud, Money Laundering	


					By Bay City News •

Published March 29, 2022 •
Updated on March 29, 2022 at 9:37 pm 
























A retired San Jose Police officer was sentenced to three years in jail on Tuesday for using a side security business to commit millions of dollars in insurance fraud, money laundering, tax evasion and worker exploitation, the Santa Clara District Attorney's Office said.  
Robert Foster, 48, of Morgan Hill, was convicted of several felonies, including 173 acts of conspiring to commit $1.3 million in insurance fraud and $18 million in money laundering to cover it up, the DA's office said.  
Foster owns Atlas Private Security (now Genesis Private Security) with his wife, Makaila Foster, 46, who also pleaded no contest to the same insurance fraud and money laundering charges, according to prosecutors. She will be sentenced to a year in jail and five years of probation beginning on April 20.   
The six-month investigation into the Fosters uncovered many crimes carried out as managers of the security company. The Fosters illegally reduced their workers' compensation insurance premiums and taxes by reporting false and inaccurate payrolls, underreporting headcounts, paying employees off-the-books, and underreporting employee injuries, the DA said. The couple also failed to employees overtime and dissuaded those employees from accurately reporting on-the-job injuries and wage-theft violations.

The probe also uncovered that the Fosters hid millions of dollars of payroll through a complex subcontractor-masking scheme. According to the DA, employees were paid by a different security company, Defense Protection Group, which had no knowledge of the employees' hours, wages, or schedules. Instead, the DA asserts, DPG simply moved money from the Fosters' firm to the employees so that the couple could avoid paying their fair share of taxes, workers comp insurance and overtime wages.  
Before sentencing, Foster paid $1.3 million in restitution to Everest National Insurance and the Employment Development Department, the DA said. A general order of restitution for exploited workers was also given.  
""No one is above accountability for illegally trying to make a profit on the backs and injured bodies of their workers,"" said Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen.

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson testifies during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on March 23, 2022.Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination brings renewed attention to lack of Black judges on the federal benchBy Chandelis Duster and Priya Krishnakumar, CNNUpdated 1644 GMT (0044 HKT) April 3, 2022 (CNN)As the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court has ignited a discussion about the historic lack of diversity on the nation's highest court, her ascendance has also renewed focus on the absence of Black judges on the federal judiciary's lower courts.Of the 3,852 people who have been confirmed as federal judges, a CNN analysis of data from the Federal Judicial Center shows that 240 of them -- 6% -- have been Black. Seventy-one of them have been Black women. More than three-quarters of all the judges have been White men.

And while strides have been made in recent years to improve the demographic makeup of the federal bench, the judiciary still skews dramatically toward White, male judges, especially when compared to the rest of the country. Almost 80% of all Article III judges -- the federal judges who are nominated by a US president and confirmed by the US Senate -- are White, and 71% are men, with large gaps persisting in Latino, Black and women's representation in the federal courts, the data shows, despite Black Americans accounting for 12.4% of the US population. 

That lack of representation is an obstacle for aspiring judges of color in a career pipeline when it comes to openings on the Supreme Court -- while also having a negative impact on a judicial system in which judges are expected to make fair and impartial decisions on issues affecting an ever-diversifying country, experts told CNN.Read More""One thing that we know erodes public confidence in the judiciary is when judges and other judicial actors (like juries) fails to reflect the diversity of the citizens who rely on our courts to mete out impartial justice,"" Stacy Hawkins, vice dean and professor at Rutgers Law School, told CNN. ""Citizens simply lack trust in the system when the system does not appear to adequately reflect their interests."" Wide-ranging reasons for lack of representationConstance Baker Motley, former Manhattan borough president, was named by President Lyndon Johnson in 1966 to fill a vacancy on the federal district court in New York City.Up until the 1960s, the federal bench was comprised almost exclusively of White men. In 1966, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Constance Baker Motley to the Southern District of New York, making her the first Black woman to become a federal judge. In the decade to follow, the federal bench saw a substantial increase in judges of color after former President Jimmy Carter announced a priority appointing more diverse judges. Overall, only 137 Hispanic Americans have been federal judges in US history, 53 have been Asian American and four have been Native American.There is a clear partisan divide in judicial appointments, with Democratic presidents nominating more Black and non-White judges to the federal bench than Republican presidents. In total, Democratic presidents have nominated 180 Black judges to the federal judiciary, while 60 were nominated by Republicans. Among Black federal judges who are still actively serving, 115 were nominated by Democrats, and 37 were nominated by Republicans. 

President Joe Biden has also emphasized diversity in many of his judicial appointments. Just over a year into his term, 67% of his confirmed nominees to the federal bench have been non-White, the highest share of any president. By comparison, just 16% of former President Donald Trump's confirmed nominees during his term were non-White. There are several reasons for a lack of diversity on the federal bench, law experts told CNN, including systemic discrimination, bias and unequal access to opportunities in the legal profession. Other factors include underrepresentation in judicial clerkships, prestigious experiences often seen in the background of judges, and underrepresentation in law firm partnerships. Early on, US Presidents, who have the power to appoint federal judges and accept recommendations for judicial candidates from lawmakers, including senators who vote on whether to confirm those appointed, also did not prioritize appointing diverse judges. There is also the fact that federal judges are appointed to their roles for life and not a set term. ""When you combine life tenure with increases in average life span, you have few opportunities for federal judicial vacancies. So, it takes a lot of time to shift the demographic composition of the bench through the appointments process,"" Hawkins told CNN, adding that because vacancies are so limited, there are often far more qualified judicial candidates than there are seats to fill. The lack of diverse representation on the bench also has a negative impact on the de facto pipeline in which aspiring judges climb the legal profession ranks.""The lack of diversity on the bench right now also kind of contributes to the lack of diversity on that pipeline because you don't have necessarily an expansive set of networks to help folks navigate those processes,"" Alicia Bannon, director of the judiciary program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told CNN. Black lawyers are already underrepresented in the legal profession more broadly, with only 5% of all lawyers being Black, according to the American Bar Association. And while progress has been made in employment among Black law graduates, narrowing gaps in employment are still quite considerable, according to an analysis by the National Association for Law Placement released in 2021. Law school enrollment over the past decade has declined by 25%, according to a study by the American Bar Federation looking at enrollment from 1999-2019. At that time, Black and Hispanic students made up a larger share of law school enrollment since the Great Recession, but Black and Hispanic students were disproportionately enrolled in lower-ranked schools with lower rates of bar passage and post-graduation employment, the study also found. ""The pipeline for judges runs through law schools,"" said Tomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University, adding that law school candidates have to be prepared by courses studied in college and in high school. ""There is a need to pay attention to increasing and ensuring equal opportunity at all levels of the educational system and in the legal profession."" 'Visible diversity breeds visible diversity'Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, left, administers the oath of office to US District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, right, with Jackson's husband Patrick Jackson, center, holding the Bible, during an official investiture ceremeony.  May 9, 2013.  One way to increase diversity on the federal bench is to increase the number of diverse legal professionals in the de facto pipeline to the federal bench and Black representation in law schools, experts told CNN. Judicial clerkships -- which are coveted and competitive opportunities for lawyers and graduates to shadow a judge -- allow one to gain upfront experience and insight into a judgeship itself. Law graduates of color are underrepresented in all levels of judicial clerkships, particularly at the federal level, according to an analysis by the National Association for Law Placement that was released in February 2021. Just 2.1% of Black graduates are at the federal clerkship level, the group found. US Presidents and lawmakers should also be committed to diversity in appointments and recommendations, Bannon told CNN. Role-modeling from the bench itself could also lead to a diverse pipeline and Brown-Nagin said Jackson's appointment could inspire other Black women to pursue judgeships. ""Visible diversity breeds visible diversity. Meaning, if Black women historically have not been appointed judges, then it stands to reason that Black women don't think that they're likely to be appointed judges. It's just a sort of a vicious circle,"" Brown-Nagin said. Jackson, a Harvard Law graduate who went on to serve on the federal judiciary for nearly a decade, clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer during the 1999 term; Judge Bruce M. Selya, a federal judge in Massachusetts; and US District Judge Patti Saris in Massachusetts. During her confirmation hearing, she spoke of the importance for law students of color to have access to clerkships and said her experience as a clerk ""changed the trajectory of her career."" ""It has been a part of my practice to go to schools, to reach out to young people, to tell them about clerking, to try to get them to apply to me if I can and to show them that this is something that is possible,"" Jackson said. ""If I can do it, they can do it. And I think it is to the benefit of us all to have as many different law students seeking clerkships as possible.""

Richard Faithfull sentenced to over 5 years imprisonment for money laundering





 









Richard Faithfull sentenced to over 5 years imprisonment for money laundering


Press Releases
First published: 						09/09/2021

Last updated: 09/09/2021










On Thursday 9 September 2021 Richard Faithfull was sentenced to 5 years and 10 months imprisonment for laundering money, contrary to s.327 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. He was also disqualified from being a company director for a period of 10 years.




Faithfull had previously pleaded guilty to that offence on 16 April 2021 and put forward a basis of plea that sought to minimise his role in the offending. The FCA did not accept Faithfull’s basis of plea and the matter was listed for a Newton hearing – a trial of fact on a plea before a single judge – to determine the basis upon which he should be sentenced.
Following a 4-day hearing the judge, His Honour Judge Tomlinson, rejected the submissions made by Richard Faithfull’s legal team and accepted the FCA’s statement of the case.
Richard Faithfull laundered £2.5million as part of a trans-national organised crime group for longer than 12 months, laundering the proceeds of, at least, 7 professionally run overseas investment frauds.
The operation was sophisticated, utilising multiple accounts and front companies in numerous jurisdictions. Faithfull was able to use knowledge gained when he worked in the regulated sector - as an investment advisor - to help the fraudsters continue to defraud victims by paying fictional 'dividends' from bank accounts controlled by him to make it look as though the underlying investments were generating returns. He also involved innocent parties to help assist with his criminal enterprise.
To avoid detection he relocated to Ukraine where he lived a life of luxury whilst he continued his criminal activities, enlisting the assistance of local criminal groups abroad. Following his arrest, he spun a web of lies to try and throw the FCA off the case but at the hearing held last week he finally accepted that he was a 'thoroughly dishonest person'.
The sentencing judge remarked that it was 'serious offending' which was linked to the 'human misery caused by boiler room fraud' and that 'money coming in [to accounts controlled by Faithfull] was not being invested, it was simply being slaughtered'.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said: 'Mr Faithfull’s actions showed little compassion for those affected by the underlying criminality instead seeking only to make a profit for himself and others. The FCA remain committed to ensuring that those who choose to break the law are brought to justice. We remind investors to check the FCA’s register are part of their due diligence when looking to make investments.'
The FCA will now pursue confiscation proceedings against him in order to try and seize his illegal gains.
Notes to editors
Faithfull is to be sentenced re Essex firearms offences separately.
This was a joint investigation with the City of London Police.
Previous updates on the case.
Newton Hearings are used where the 2 sides offer such conflicting evidence that a judge sitting alone tries to ascertain which party is telling the truth.

Monzo Faces FCA Investigation Into Alleged AML Contraventions

London FinTech Monzo is facing an investigation from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) over allegations of possibly violating anti-money laundering (AML) laws, Financial Times reported on Friday (July 30).
Monzo CEO TS Anil said in its most recent annual report that despite a year that posed numerous obstacles, the digital bank showed fortitude and posted a “significant amount of growth,” FT reported.
The challenger bank also used its annual report to discuss the startup’s current FCA probe regarding alleged AML violations. But the report also turned the spotlight on Monzo’s ability to keep losses at bay despite early hits from the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.
Anil said Monzo has its sights set on turning a profit next year and would raise additional funds in the coming months that will power growth and help it keep a few steps ahead of regulations regarding capital.
Monzo landed over £200 million (approximately $278 million) during its last year, while the FinTech is “fielding a significant amount of inbound interest” from new and present investors, Anil said, according to the FT report.
Although the FCA’s investigations are just getting out of the gate, the probe potentially includes both criminal and civil liability, Monzo said, per FT.
“The prevention of financial crime is an issue that affects the entire banking industry and one which Monzo is taking extremely seriously. Over the past year we have made major investments in our controls in this area as a priority and will continue to invest heavily in this part of the business,” Monzo said, per FT.
Monzo is not the only challenger bank facing scrutiny over money laundering allegations. In Germany neobank N26 was ordered by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) to step up its AML efforts. BaFin mandated that N26 Bank change how it approaches IT monitoring and customer due diligence.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Third Founder Of Cryptocurrency Exchange Pleads Guilty To Bank Secrecy Act Violations
Samuel Reed Designed BitMEX as a Platform to Flout U.S. Anti-Money Laundering Rules
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that SAMUEL REED, one of three co-founders and a high-ranking executive of purportedly “off-shore” cryptocurrency derivatives exchange the Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange or “BitMEX,” pled guilty today to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”) by willfully failing to establish, implement, and maintain an anti-money laundering (“AML”) program at BitMEX.  Under the terms of his plea agreement, REED agreed to separately pay a $10 million criminal fine representing pecuniary gain derived from the offense.  REED pled guilty today before Chief U.S. District Judge Laura T. Swain, and will be sentenced by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl.  The other two founders of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, previously pled guilty to the same offense in February 2022.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said:  “Samuel Reed has now joined his co-founders, Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, in admitting that they caused BitMEX to commit criminal violations of the anti-money laundering laws that govern financial institutions operating in the United States.  As today’s guilty plea reflects, this Office will not permit cryptocurrency exchanges to operate as a shadow financial system that enables criminal actors to move their illicit proceeds without detection, and will vigorously investigate and prosecute the operators of such exchanges who deliberately flout U.S. law.”
According to the Indictment, public court filings, and statements made in court:[1]
REED, together with Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, was one of the three co-founders and the long-time Chief Technology Officer of BitMEX.  BitMEX is an online cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that, during the relevant time period, had U.S.-based operations and served thousands of U.S. customers, notwithstanding false representations to the contrary by the company.  From at least September 2015, and continuing at least through the time of the Indictment in September 2020, REED willfully caused BitMEX to fail to establish and maintain an AML program, including a program for verifying the identify of BitMEX’s customers (or a “know your customer” or “KYC” program).  As a result of its willful failure to implement AML and KYC programs, BitMEX was in effect a money laundering platform.  For example, in about May 2018, REED was notified of allegations that BitMEX was being used to launder the proceeds of a cryptocurrency hack.  Neither REED nor the company filed a suspicious activity report thereafter (indeed, BitMEX filed no suspicious activity reports at all between 2014 and September 2020), nor did BitMEX implement an AML or KYC program in response. 
REED failed to institute AML or KYC programs at BitMEX despite closely following U.S. regulatory developments that made clear his legal obligation to do so if BitMEX operated in the United States, which it did.  Despite repeatedly stating that BitMEX did not serve U.S. customers, including to individuals outside of BitMEX, REED knew that BitMEX’s purported withdrawal from the U.S. market in or about September 2015 was a sham, and that purported “controls” BitMEX put in place to prevent U.S. trading were an ineffective facade that did not, in fact, prevent users from accessing or trading on BitMEX from the United States.  REED not only understood that U.S. customers continued to trade on BitMEX, but derived substantial profits from BitMEX as a result of U.S.-based trading. 
*                *                *
REED, 32, of Massachusetts, pled guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentence in this case is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.
Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI’s New York Money Laundering Investigation Squad, and thanked the attorneys and investigators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission whose expertise and diligence were integral to the development of this investigation.
The prosecution is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jessica Greenwood, Samuel Raymond, and Thane Rehn are in charge of the prosecution. 


[1] Two of REED’s co-defendants, Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, pled guilty to violating the BSA in February 2022. As to REED’s remaining co-defendant, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.

I signed up for that’Joanna Partridge Doug Bannister at Dover’s cruise terminal. When he told his family he was taking the job, his father-in-law asked him: ‘Are you mad?’ Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverDoug Bannister at Dover’s cruise terminal. When he told his family he was taking the job, his father-in-law asked him: ‘Are you mad?’ Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverThe US executive took over the port in 2019, in the heat of the debate about the EU. He’s not surprised it’s been a challengeSat 2 Apr 2022 16.00 BSTLast modified on Mon 4 Apr 2022 11.10 BSTWhen Doug Bannister told his family he would be joining the Port of Dover as its chief executive, weeks before the original March 2019 Brexit date, his father-in-law voiced what many might have thought: “Are you mad?”The softly spoken American clearly isn’t one to shy away from a daunting task, including taking over at Britain’s busiest port during what he calls the “once in a generation” change in the country’s trading relationship with its closest neighbours.As negotiations dragged on, Brexit was delayed for another year, but when it came, the change was seismic. “It was such a significant transformation that the nation was going through, and Dover is the epicentre of that activity. And I did sign up for that,” Bannister says.Even if, on arrival, he was pleasantly surprised at the port’s preparations for Brexit, he never could have forecast the other storm clouds gathering on the horizon. Covid repeatedly disrupted traffic on Britain’s busiest trade route, halted most leisure travel for two years, and even saw France close its border in December 2020 to all travellers, including truck drivers, from England.The drop-off in traffic put pressure on the finances of the port, run by the Dover Harbour Board, which was granted a royal charter in 1606. It does not have any external shareholders, and its “trust port” status prevented it from tapping investors or going to the capital markets to raise cash during the pandemic.Freight traffic has largely returned to pre-Brexit, pre-pandemic levels at the UK’s most important “ro-ro” port (so named because vehicles roll on and roll off the ships), Bannister says, although leisure travel has been recovering more slowly. A third of all the UK’s trade in goods with the EU is handled by Dover, according to the latest figures from consultancy Oxera, which translates to a value of about £144bn. About 10,000 lorries travel through it each day – 31% of all the HGVs that visit UK seaports.CVAge 57Family Married with four children, three of whom live with him in Kent, while his eldest daughter lives in the US.Education BA in economics at St Lawrence University in New York state; MBA at Seton Hall University in New Jersey.Pay Basic salary of £300,000. In 2020 he was paid an additional £122,000 in bonuses, pension contributions and benefits.Last holiday Devon, last summer: “It was glorious.”Best advice he’s been given “Go into any change positively.” He believes “an early positive attitude” about change, “combined with early engagement, generally leads to a better outcome”.Biggest career mistake “I think I was not a good father to my first daughter. I was spending so much time working and travelling around the world for work that I missed her childhood. I have a very good relationship with her now.”Word he overuses “I probably use the word ‘wicked’ a lot.”How he relaxes Spending time with his children and in the garden.Bannister says he “fell into” his long maritime career after taking a job with small shipping group Trans Freight Lines in the US, following a degree in economics. The 57-year-old would go on to work at P&O’s container shipping division before it merged with Dutch line Royal Nedlloyd and was subsequently bought by the Danish giant Maersk.His latest challenge has arrived out of a clear blue sky: as we pulled up outside the passenger cruise terminal, an enormous symbol of it hove into view. P&O Ferries’ hulking Spirit of Britain hasn’t travelled anywhere since the company sacked 800 workers on 17 March. The 213-metre-long ferry, one of the largest operating in Europe, would usually only dock briefly at Dover during its five daily round trips between Kent and northern France.“We were looking forward to increasing passenger trade as Covid travel restrictions eased off, and so it is going to be difficult to handle that having the P&O ferries off the route. We hope they get them back sailing again in time for Easter, if not in time for the summer,” Bannister says.While P&O Ferries’ ships remain tied up, rival operators have scrambled to take extra passengers, with the port helping coordinate. Despite this, Bannister appears reluctant to pass judgment on the firm – whose chief executive effectively admitted breaching employment law by dismissing his staff without notice – or on the wider issue of rates of pay for international seafarers.Assessing wages for crew is not always straightforward as “frequently international seafarers don’t pay any income taxes, because they are not a part of any particular nation,” Bannister says. “Some routes are different, like domestic routes like the Isle of Wight or maybe up in the Scottish islands. It’s not necessarily a straight apples for apples comparison, but I do think it is right that people should get paid for the work that they do in the best way that they can be.”People will get slicker at reading passports, get slicker at lodging paperwork and checking paperwork. But we are in a different trading regimeDoug BannisterEven before the P&O scandal, port traffic had been repeatedly disrupted during the first weeks of the year, including by the introduction of new EU import controls, increased freight traffic, roadworks and a reduction in ferry services as vessels were refitted.Traffic was flowing freely on the day the Observer visited, and there was no sign of the queue of lorries frequently seen snaking up the A20 road, which winds down to the coast. Bannister believes this is partly due to traders and hauliers getting used to new requirements, which include time-consuming passport and paperwork checks.He concedes a consequence of Brexit is longer processing times at the border. “There will be improvements which are made. People will get slicker at reading passports, get slicker at lodging paperwork and checking paperwork. But we are in a different trading regime.”An impending change, which could again lead to queues at the port, is also weighing on Bannister’s mind. In September, the EU intends to introduce airport-style biometric checks at its external borders. This would affect Dover because of “juxtaposed controls”, where travellers clear French entry requirements before leaving the UK, and he has called on the British government to work with the EU on a solution.The Spirit of Britain (foreground) moored at Dover in the wake of the P&O scandal. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA“To date, no process has been identified for a carload of people transiting a busy ferry terminal on a dark stormy night,” he says. “It would force people to exit their vehicles in busy moving traffic, which would be dangerous. We couldn’t allow that to happen.”Over the centuries, Dover has capitalised on its “geographic advantage” of being located just 22 miles across the Channel from France. Bannister is convinced the recent bounceback in trade highlights the success of the “short straits”: the shortest distance between the UK and the continent. “The market has chosen,” he says. “We have three different ferry operators operating from the port, two ports in France to go to, and then the Eurotunnel running alongside us.”Bannister’s career has taken him on a circumnavigation of the globe from his home state of New Jersey to the island of Jersey – where he ran the airport and harbours – via Rotterdam, Australia (his favourite place to live and work) and New Zealand. Now, he clearly gets a kick out of working for an organisation as rich in history as this one, despite the varied challenges since he took up the role in Dover.“It’d be nice if there were a few less disruptions,” he says. “This business has been around for 400 years; it’s got incredible heritage. It’ll be here for another 400 years.”TopicsInternational tradeObserver business profileEconomicsGlobal economyBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policyinterviewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

As British Columbia’s government rolled out new laws aimed at cracking down on massive, questionable transactions flowing through casinos on Canada’s West Coast, the number of suspicious cash investigations in Ontario’s casinos more than doubled in 2018, a Global News investigation has found.
Experts fear the international drug cartels that targeted B.C. casinos to wash dirty money have now shifted their focus to Ontario.“Money laundering is like a product of their crime, just like dead kids and corrupt politicians. So that dirty money will find the cracks and flow to more vulnerable systems in Canada,” said Calvin Chrustie, a former senior RCMP officer who targeted transnational organized crime groups in Vancouver and internationally.

 The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) logged 945 suspicious transaction investigations at casinos in 2017. That more than doubled to 2,266 transactions in 2018 — a roughly 140 per cent increase, according to data obtained exclusively by Global News. The OPP data shows suspicious transaction investigations, which include investigations into potential money laundering, continued to trend higher in 2019, with 1,327 investigations in the first seven months of the year.

Two months later, B.C.

Experts say that as criminal networks sought out different regions in which to park their dirty cash, their focus may have turned to Ontario.“The criminal networks involved haven’t been touched, and they are still selling their drugs and making their money,” Chrustie said.

In an interview with Global News, Chief Supt. Bill Price of the OPP’s dedicated casino investigations unit acknowledged that due to an intense spotlight and new restrictions in B.C. casinos, money launderers likely have shifted focus to Ontario casinos.But Price said the 140 per cent increase in suspicious transaction investigations is also due, in part, to more gambling in the Greater Toronto Area and the OPP’s increased scrutiny of that gambling.

“If you turn a slot facility into a full-blown casino with table games, there’s larger transactions that automatically occur that should generate suspicious transaction reports,” Price said. “Woodbine (casino) itself went from a slot facility to a full-blown casino. That changes the dynamics.  Story continues below advertisement



 “Are we concerned about people from other jurisdictions coming here to infiltrate our casinos? Absolutely. But we have a very good model in place to prevent that and disrupt that activity as much as possible.”How widespread is the issue?The new data shows there is a “preponderance of money laundering” flowing through the province’s casinos that requires immediate action from Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative government, said Garry Clement, former director of the RCMP proceeds of crime unit.“[Ontario officials] can say that they don’t have a money-laundering problem. If they do, they have their heads in the sand,” Clement said.“The only way we’re ever going to get a full understanding and get a handle on it, is really to do a deep dive and recognize that there is likely a substantial amount of money laundering occurring.”

B.C. disbands RCMP unit after report warns possible crime figure bought stake in casino – Jan 15, 2020

Global News has previously reported that, in the past decade, just under $2 billion in suspicious cash could have flowed through B.C. Lottery Corp. casinos, with large amounts funded by loan sharks and criminal bank drafts.  Story continues below advertisement



 B.C. is set to begin an inquiry on how money laundering has distorted the province’s housing market and contributed to the ongoing opioid crisis. Exactly how much dirty money is being laundered through Ontario casinos is unknown. But the same method of money laundering seen in B.C. — known as bulk cash “refining” — is being used, Price said.“A very basic example of currency refining is you walk into the casino with $10,000… Very minimal gameplay, you go to the cashier’s cage and cash out with $9,000. You’ve got a casino receipt, and you’ve just basically laundered $9,000,” he said.Police allege $70 million in dirty moneyThe method described by Price was used in several Ontario casinos by the Figliomeni crime family, according to York Regional Police.Last July, a joint OPP investigation with Italian police — dubbed Project Sindacato — alleged Angelo Figliomeni and nearly two dozen others linked to the ‘Ndrangheta organized crime syndicate may have laundered roughly $70 million through Ontario casinos.Figliomeni was charged with directing a criminal organization and possessing proceeds of crime, and charges related to defrauding the government, willfully evading taxes and making false tax statements. The allegations have not been proven in court.

 Details of the lengthy investigation alleged members of the Figliomeni crime family were given VIP treatment at Ontario casinos, including limo rides, meal vouchers, tickets to shows and free booze, according to police.“They were treated very well,” said York Regional Police Det. Sgt. Carl Mattinen.

The ‘Ndrangheta originates from Calabria, Italy, and according to a 2013 Europol threat assessment, is one of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful organized crime groups, with tentacles stretching around the world, including into Ontario.High-ranking members of the Figliomeni crime family went to the casinos nightly with $30,000 to $50,000, according to Mattinen.“They would gamble a lot, treat it almost like a tax. You lose a little bit of funds and you leave with clean cash,” he said.  Story continues below advertisement

Mattinen wouldn’t name the casinos favoured by the alleged gangsters — targets of Project Sindacato — because the case is still before the courts.Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation refused to comment, as the matter is the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation.“OLG does not disclose the specifics of a customer’s play history in accordance with personal privacy rules,” a spokesperson said.Clement said that if one crime network was using casinos to launder the proceeds of drug dealing and illegal gaming, there are likely others.“Criminals go to the lane of least resistance,” he said. “If that group was doing $70 million, I can tell you there are other organized crime groups doing $70 million.”

Great Canadian Gaming Corp., the operator of the expanded Woodbine casino, was asked to respond to the sharp increase in suspicious transactions investigations logged by the OPP at the casino since its new table-gaming operations were launched in 2018.  Story continues below advertisement



 In 2017, there were eight suspicious transactions investigations recorded by the OPP, and in 2018, there were 58. From January to Aug. 1, 2019, there were 76 suspicious transactions investigations logged by OPP investigators working at the Woodbine casino.“Like other gaming operators based in Canada, Great Canadian has a clearly delineated role in Anti Money Laundering (AML) protocol as set out in federal legislation,” a prepared statement attributed to Great Canadian’s chief compliance officer Terrance Doyle said. “Fundamentally, our role is to identify and report unusual and large cash transactions. In undertaking this role in Ontario, our obligation is to adhere to all mandated rules and regulations, and even exceed those requirements to ensure a robust AML regime is followed.”Why can’t Canada prosecute money launderers?

Money laundering expert says Canada failing to prosecute financial crimes – Feb 10, 2019

Almost three-quarters of people accused of money laundering in Canada go free. From 2000 to 2016, 321 people were found guilty in money-laundering cases, resulting in a conviction rate of around 27 per cent.  Story continues below advertisement



 Chrustie — who runs a global risk consultancy service focused on organized crime threats — believes Canada’s inability to fight transnational organized crime is the root of the money-laundering problem. And even if police and prosecutors focus on money laundering, only changes to the legal system will put them in a stronger position to target international gangs, he says.

Canada’s courts require police to reveal massive amounts of case evidence to defence attorneys under tight deadlines — in comparison to American and Australian court systems — which can lead to errors that hinder prosecutions.“Transnational gangs are operating in an ocean, and Canadian police are operating in a fishbowl,” Chrustie said.

Anti-money-laundering experts told Global News this issue was a factor in Canada’s largest-ever money-laundering probe, the failed RCMP E-Pirate investigation, which targeted a mainland Chinese drug cartel allegedly laundering cash in B.C. Lottery casinos.  Story continues below advertisement



 Another factor making Canada an attractive place to launder money is a lack of experienced investigators and prosecutors to take on these complex financial crimes, according to Clement.Clement pointed to the shuttering of the RCMP’s financial crime units in B.C. in 2009 and in Ontario just this past December.“What it does is it disillusions the membership. It results in a lack of buildup of expertise, which the RCMP, I think, is waning big time in that area right now,” he said. “As a result of that, it’s a great day for organized crime.”

RBI likely to maintain status quo on rates to support growth, say analysts
Amidst the deleterious impact of the war, the RBI will be walking a tightrope on its monetary policy decisions, striving to control inflation within the tolerance band while at the same time supporting nascent growth impulses, he said.

  Amidst the deleterious impact of the war, the RBI will be walking a tightrope on its monetary policy decisions, striving to control inflation within the tolerance band while at the same time supporting nascent growth impulses, he said. 
The Reserve Bank is likely to maintain status quo on interest rates in its forthcoming monetary policy review but may change the stance in view of retail inflation piercing its upper tolerance limit, global uncertainties created by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and the urgency to protect and boost growth, feel experts.
The RBI Governor-headed rate setting panel — Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) — will be holding its first meeting of the 2022-23 fiscal from April 6 to 8. The outcome will be announced on April 8.
Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist of ICRA Limited, said in the April 2022 policy review, the MPC is expected to revise up its Consumer Price Index-based inflation forecast, whereas the growth projections for 2022-23 would be pared.
“Nevertheless, the MPC is unlikely to sacrifice growth to control imported inflation. With the upper threshold of the medium-term inflation target range being as high as 6 per cent, the MPC is likely to remain growth supportive for longer than other central banks. Overall, we expect a status quo policy in April 2022,” she said.
Given the current uncertainties, Suman Chowdhury, Chief Analytical Officer, Acuité Ratings & Research, opined that RBI “has limited scope to tighten monetary policy”.
Amidst the deleterious impact of the war, the RBI will be walking a tightrope on its monetary policy decisions, striving to control inflation within the tolerance band while at the same time supporting nascent growth impulses, he said.
“Going forward, we expect the RBI to restore the width of the LAF corridor to its pre-pandemic levels by hiking the reverse repo rate by 40 bps over Jun-Aug 2022 policy review, followed by a cumulative 50 bps hike in the repo rate in the rest of 2022-23,” Chowdhury said.
On the other hand, Dhruv Agarwala, Group CEO, Housing.com, Makaan.com & PropTiger.com, opined that given the increase in inflationary pressure due to the war in Ukraine, it will be difficult for the RBI to continue maintaining a status quo on key policy rates in its upcoming monetary policy.
“While this would hurt the recovery process in India post the disruptions caused by the various waves of the coronavirus pandemic, the RBI may not have the flexibility to avoid a rate hike,” he said.
Agarwala further said any upward tweak at this stage might have an impact on real estate as well, but the numbers for the March quarter, show that the real estate sector is on a strong footing and may continue to cover the lost ground due to the pandemic on the back of strong pent-up demand.
Japanese brokerage Nomura in a research report said the RBI is likely to re-evaluate its projection for both GDP growth and CPI inflation in the upcoming policy meeting.
However, the RBI is likely to suggest that inflationary pressures are temporary, that inflation will remain below its 6 per cent upper-bound, and that monetary policy should remain supportive of growth.
Hence, even as there is a reasonable likelihood that the RBI will take its first reluctant step towards policy rate normalisation in the April 8 meeting by changing stance from ‘accommodative’ to ‘neutral’, it is likely to balance it with a dovish guidance, it said.
“We believe the RBI is overly optimistic on inflation, and that a course correction in monetary policy is warranted. We expect a policy pivot in June and hence are building in 100bp in cumulative repo rate hikes in 2022,” the report said.
The government has mandated the central bank to keep the inflation at 4 per cent (+,- 2 per cent). After the February MPC meeting, the RBI had decided to hold its key lending rates steady at record low levels for the 10th straight meeting to support a durable recovery of the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Apollomics doses first subject in Phase III AML therapy trial in China
The trial will enrol approximately 140 adults at nearly 20 blood cancer clinical research centres in the country. 

























Apollomics has dosed the first participant in a Phase III clinical trial of its new drug, APL-106 (uproleselan injection), in China to treat relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients.
Uproleselan has been licensed by Apollomics in the Greater China region from GlycoMimetics, which discovered and developed the drug.
The drug can potentially hinder E-selectin from adhering to blood cancer cells, to destroy the leukemic cell resistance mechanism within the bone marrow microenvironment.
The randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, bridging trial will assess uproleselan efficacy along with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone to treat adult patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

Athira doses first subject in Phase I neuropsychiatric treatment trial







Nealy 140 adults with primary refractory or relapsed AML, who are eligible for induction chemotherapy, will be enrolled in the trial. 


  

 
Overall survival is the primary goal of the trial while remission rate and duration; and uproleselan’s ability to reduce oral mucositis rate will be included as secondary goals.
The company plans to carry out the trial at nearly 20 blood cancer clinical research centres in the country.
This trial is part of Apollomics’ complete development programme in China, which also comprises a Phase I pharmacokinetic and tolerability trial currently underway.
Apollomics co-founder, chairman and CEO Guo-Liang Yu said: “As our first Phase III clinical trial, dosing of the first patient with APL-106 is a major inflection point for Apollomics as we now become a company in late-stage development.
“APL-106 acts via an innovative mechanism that drives cancer cells out of the bone marrow, making them a prime target to be killed by chemotherapy.
“This combined treatment approach could have a meaningful impact on the lives of patients living with relapsed or refractory AML.”
AML is a kind of cancer that affects blood and bone marrow.

Acquisition of Citi India’s consumer business to boost Axis Bank’s retail franchise: S&P
“The acquisition will reduce Axis Bank’s capital buffer because it plans use excess capital to fund the deal. The bank’s S&P Global Ratings Risk-Adjusted Capital (RAC) ratio was 8.5 per cent as of March 31, 2021,” it said.

  ""We expect significant profitability improvements to only accrue from fiscal 2025 onwards as it will take time to complete the acquisition and integrate the assets. The acquisition is likely to be completed over the next nine to 12 months, while full integration will take another 18 months,"" the agency said in a statement. 
Axis Bank’s planned acquisition of Citigroup’s consumer banking portfolio will strengthen its retail market position as well as diversify the revenue profile, global rating agency S&P said on Friday.
“We expect significant profitability improvements to only accrue from fiscal 2025 onwards as it will take time to complete the acquisition and integrate the assets. The acquisition is likely to be completed over the next nine to 12 months, while full integration will take another 18 months,” the agency said in a statement.
Earnings will also depend on Axis Bank’s (BB+/Positive/B) ability to retain acquired customers and successfully cross-sell its products and services to them, it said.
Axis Bank should be able to absorb any incremental risks given the small size of Citi’s portfolio, it said, adding, the acquired portfolio is equivalent to about 4 per cent of Axis Bank’s loans, and it comprises credit cards, mortgage loans, personal loans, asset-backed finance and small business banking loans.Citi’s portfolio mainly comprised affluent clients, where credit quality tends to be better than mass-market customers. Citi’s spending per credit card is higher than Axis Bank’s as well as the average for Indian banks.
The acquisition is positive for Axis Bank’s long-term profitability, it said, adding, a large part of the portfolio is unsecured, where yields are higher than mortgages.
Axis Bank’s credit card customer base will increase by 2.5 million through this acquisition — a 31 per cent jump which enhances its market position in this segment, the report said.
Also, the acquired deposits are mostly low-cost saving accounts with good quality corporate salary accounts, where cross-selling can be profitable.“The acquisition will reduce Axis Bank’s capital buffer because it plans use excess capital to fund the deal. The bank’s S&P Global Ratings Risk-Adjusted Capital (RAC) ratio was 8.5 per cent as of March 31, 2021,” it said.
As per the initial estimates, this acquisition can reduce the RAC ratio by about 100 basis points. “Despite the deterioration, we expect the RAC ratio to stay sufficient for its rating,” it said.
The bank’s earnings will remain supportive of its capital position, and it enjoys good access to markets and can raise additional capital to restore buffers and fund organic growth, it added.

Danske Bank Secures a Big Victory in Investor Suit Based on Alleged AML Violations


By Izabella Babchinetskaya on September 9, 2021
Posted in Civil Liability to Private Parties, Investor Suits




Copenhagen, Denmark
Danske Bank (Danske) recently secured a big victory in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  On August 25, 2021, the appellate court unanimously affirmed the Southern District of New York’s dismissal of an investor lawsuit brought by purchasers of DB American Depository Receipts (ADR) against Danske and its former officers and board members over alleged misrepresentations about Danske’s financial condition.  We previously blogged about the lower court’s decision here.  As we have blogged about here, here, here, and here, Danske Bank has been the subject of significant regulatory oversight due to its alleged AML failures of historical proportions, which has resulted in a foreseeable onslaught of investor lawsuits.
Although much of the Second Circuit’s opinion is focused on timing issues relevant to almost any investor lawsuit based on material misstatements and omissions, portions of the opinion are particularly relevant to investor claims resting on alleged AML failures and money laundering by financial institution customers.  Importantly, neither knowledge of potential misconduct by customers gained by an institution from either its AML-related monitoring or whistleblower reporting, nor generalized claims to investors by an institution of robust AML compliance, will – standing alone – result in liability.
As a recap, the class action sought relief for Danske’s alleged failure to follow AML protocols in regards to its Estonian Branch—a scandal that first surfaced in 2016, eventually shedding light on approximately $230 billion in alleged suspicious transactions.  The lawsuit alleged that Danske failed to supervise the Estonian Branch, responded poorly to AML issues, and made several misstatements and omissions.  Among several claims, the plaintiffs brought suit under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, as enforced by Rule 10b-5.  The appeal focused on the first element required under the provision—the existence of a material misrepresentation, misstatement, or omission.
The plaintiffs alleged five categories of misstatements and omissions.  In affirming the lower court’s decision, the appellate court held that none of the alleged misstatements or omissions were actionable—“the allegations [did] not move the claims outside of the realm of corporate mismanagement and into the realm of securities fraud.”  The five at-issue categories and the court’s reasoning as to why they were not actionable are listed below.

Financial Statements. The plaintiffs argued that Danske’s 2013 to 2015 financial statements included revenue from the illegal transactions without a disclosure of possible money laundering activity.  The court, however, emphasized that financial disclosures are not automatically misleading “by virtue of the company’s nondisclosure of suspected misconduct that may have contributed to the financial results.” The court stressed that an alleged failure to disclose in financial statements “uncharged, unadjudicated wrongdoing” generally cannot form the basis for a viable misstatement theory.  This finding is potentially quite helpful and important for financial institutions in regards to investor lawsuits based on alleged AML violations – because, almost invariably, a financial institution’s AML compliance program will identify, and therefore put the institution “on notice,” of potential misconduct (and uncharged) by customers.  Indeed, that is one of the main goals – if not the main goal – of maintaining an AML compliance program.

The court also rejected a related argument that Danske’s financial reports were per se misleading because of alleged noncompliance with standards promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board – specifically, because Danske purportedly “violated those standards by including revenue derived from unenforceable [deposit] contracts” with clients using the Estonian branch to launder money.  However, whether the contracts were actually unenforceable turned on foreign contract law, and the plaintiffs failed to identify any law or contract provision rendering the contracts unenforceable.

Goodwill Impairment. The plaintiffs claimed that it was misleading for Danske in 2014 to characterize its goodwill impairment write-down as a “technical” accounting matter when the impairment was really a consequence of Danske’s decision to eliminate its Non-Resident Portfolio (NRP) that was the source of the suspicious activity.  The court disagreed, stating that “materiality can have a half-life.”  Because of the passage of time between the statement and the purchase of shares and the scrutiny Danske faced for its AML noncompliance, the goodwill statements “were too remote in time to have ‘assumed actual significance.’”
Whistleblower Comment. Danske’s 2015 statement regarding a new whistleblower reporting system was purportedly materially misleading by omission, because “Danske misled investors by touting its new anonymous whistleblower system while failing to simultaneously discuss the issues raised” by the whistleblower who had emailed Danske executives directly about his concerns regarding money laundering in the Estonian branch.  Significantly, like the goodwill statements, the whistleblower comment was made three years before the plaintiffs purchased any ADRs, which significantly diminished this statement’s impact on investors in 2018.  This timing issue doomed the claim, even if Danske’s statement and alleged omission was assumed to be misleading.
Corporate Responsibility Statements. The plaintiffs claimed that corporate governance statements related to Danske’s AML compliance were misleading.  The court held that the general statements about the importance of acting lawfully and with integrity were mere puffery, not actionable, and not likely to have impacted investors three years after the AML scandal surfaced. More specifically, statements by Danske that it complied with internationally-recognized Know Your Customer procedures and customer due diligence standards were insufficiently detailed and specific to support a claim.  Likewise, “[a]lthough Danske averred that it took steps to comply with AML protocols and vaguely recited some AML buzzwords, it claims no particular acts of compliance.”  Therefore, no reasonable investor – particularly one who purchased the ADRs years after the “gigantic” AML scandal at Danske had surfaced – would rely on such statements when investing.
2018 Contingencies Footnote. Finally, plaintiffs asserted that Danske’s statement that it did not expect the scandal to materially impact its financial position was misleading because Danske knew that the scope of the scandal exceeded what had been reported.  The plaintiffs, however, purchased the ADRs about three weeks before this statement was made; therefore, the statement could not have influenced the price of a purchase that plaintiffs already made.

All in all, this decision is a positive result for financial institutions, as it provides several key takeaways for what a court considers to be actionable misrepresentations and omissions in the context of alleged AML violations – even in the specific context of the greatest AML scandal to date, at least in regards to sheer volume and monetary value of the alleged suspicious transactions.

The bank has been accused by Austrac of more than 20m breaches of money laundering and counter-terrorism laws.  Photograph: David Moir/EPABen ButlerTue 19 Nov 2019 22.53 GMTLast modified on Thu 21 Nov 2019 02.38 GMTAustralia’s financial intelligence agency has launched legal action against one of the country’s biggest banks, Westpac, accusing it of more than 23m breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws involving $11bn in transactions, including transfers potentially linked to child exploitation.In a statement filed with the federal court, Austrac said Westpac had failed to “carry out appropriate due diligence on customers sending money to the Philippines and South East Asia for known child exploitation risks”.Austrac said Westpac had been aware of the child exploitation risks relating to low-value payments made through one of its systems, LitePay, since 2013 but had not fixed them until June 2018.“Westpac still has not implemented appropriate automated detection scenarios to monitor for the known child exploitation risks through other channels,” Austrac told the court. “As a result, Westpac has failed to detect activity on its customers’ accounts that is indicative of child exploitation.”Westpac also failed to properly deal with a customer who “opened a number of Westpac accounts after serving a custodial sentence for child exploitation offences”, Austrac said.Commonwealth Bank profits slump as compliance bill surges by $1bnRead more“Westpac promptly identified activity on one account that was indicative of child exploitation, but failed to promptly review activity on other accounts.“This customer continued to send frequent low value payments to the Philippines through channels that were not being monitored appropriately.”The customer was among 12 on whom Austrac claims Westpac failed to carry out appropriate due diligence checks “with a view to identifying, mitigating and managing known child exploitation risks”.“Over a number of years, there were repeated patterns of frequent low value transactions on accounts held by each of these 12 customers that were indicative of child exploitation risks,” the regulator told the court.Austrac also accused Westpac of failing to properly assess the risk in dealing with correspondent banks with which it did business.“This is in spite of a number of correspondent banks disclosing higher ML/TF (money laundering and terror finance) risks, such as themselves having correspondent banking relationships with high risk or sanctioned countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, and Democratic Republic of Congo,” Austrac said.“Some correspondent banks who had disclosed such relationships had been fined by overseas regulators for sanctions or AML/CTF breaches resulting from inadequate controls.“The risk posed to Westpac was that these high risk or sanctioned countries may have been able to access the Australian payment system through these nested arrangements, unbeknownst to Westpac.”Austrac also said that between November 2013 and September 2018, Westpac failed to give it reports within the 10 days required by law about almost three-quarters of the incoming fund transfers it received from overseas banks – some 19.5m transactions totalling more than $11bn.In addition, the bank failed to file timely reports about more than 12,000 outbound transactions, including more than 2,300 sent through LitePay where “Westpac has never given Austrac a report of each of these instructions”, Austrac said.Westpac faces a theoretical maximum fine of between $391tn and $483tn, but if the breaches are found by the court it is unlikely to be ordered to pay anywhere near that amount.However, based on Austrac’s recent track record, any penalty would be likely to be extremely large.Last year, rival big four bank CBA agreed to pay Austrac $700m to settle a similar action against it in which the regulator alleged more than 53,000 breaches of AML-CTF laws.Westpac revealed it was under investigation by Austrac in November last year.“The group has recently self-reported to Austrac a failure to report a large number of international funds transfer instructions,” the bank said in its 2018 annual report.“No provision has been raised for this matter including in relation to any potential regulatory action.”In a statement to the stock exchange on Wednesday morning, Westpac said it was “reviewing Austrac’s statement of claim and will issue a further statement to the ASX once it has been assessed”.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he was “appalled” by the allegations but the lawsuit proved Austrac was doing its job.The bank is expected to make a further statement later on Wednesday.Westpac shares fell 2.15% to $25.98 on Wednesday morning.TopicsBanking BusinessAustralian security and counter-terrorismBankingWestpacnewsReuse this contentMost

Page ContentThe concerned authorities deal strictly with anyone who legitimizes or conceals the origin of the money acquired or originated from acts criminalized under Sharia or laws.The Anti- Money Laundering Permanent Committee (AMLPC) affirms that money-laundering crimes pose a serious risk to the economic and social aspects of any country, especially those of which implement weak measures in the fight against such crimes.According to AMLPC, money laundering emerges from money launderers legitimizing funds resulting from other crimes, known by law as predicate offences. This includes all offenses committed within, or any act committed outside the Kingdom if it constitutes a crime according to the laws of the State where it was committed and would have constituted an offense under the Sharia or statutory laws of the Kingdom had it been committed therein.It is noteworthy that AMLPC chaired by Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) includes representatives from the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Commerce and Investment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Labor and Social Development, Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah and Guidance, Presidency of State Security, Public Prosecution, Presidency of General Intelligence, Capital Market Authority. AMLPC was formed pursuant to the Council of Ministers Resolution No. (15) dated 17/1/1420 H corresponding to 3/5/1999 AD to implement the FATF's 40 recommendations to combat money laundering operations in accordance with the regulations in force in Saudi Arabia. One of AMLCP's tasks is to implement the above recommendations and follow up the implementation, as well as to study all topics related to combating money laundering in Saudi Arabia.The Committee pointed out that the spread of money laundering operations in any society leads to increasing crime rates, and declining in the values of education and culture because the rapid gains of those crimes do not require a scientific qualification to commit it. Money laundering operations in any country may lead to the spread of shadow economy or commercial concealment, resulting to decline the economic growth, in addition to high inflation rates, which can raise the prices, subsequently, undermining fair competition. It also has adverse effects on other business activities.The Anti-Money Laundering Law was issued by Royal Decree No. (M/20) dated 5/2/1439 AH, superseding the Anti-Money Laundering Law issued by Royal Decree No. (M / 31) dated 11/05/1433 AH. The crime of money laundering is considered a major offense requiring detention pursuant to Decision No. 2000 issued by His Highness the Minister of Interior in 1435. The authorities' concerned deal strictly with anyone who legitimizes or conceals the origin of the money acquired or originating from acts criminalized under Sharia or laws; such as illicit trafficking in drugs, weapons, currency counterfeiting and other crimes. Concealing the true origin of money (laundering) is not limited to cash, but includes assets, property and economic resources of whatever value, type or manner of ownership. When such funds arise directly or indirectly from the commission of a predicate offense, they are called proceeds. It is worthy to point out that a person conviction of money laundering crime is unconditional to the conviction of committing a predicate offence such as illicit drug trafficking.Saudi Arabia has imposed severe penalties for money launderers, as conviction for this crime is subject to a fine of up to seven million riyals and imprisonment for up to fifteen years or both. A Saudi convicted of money laundering shall be banned from traveling outside Saudi Arabia for a period similar to that of sentenced imprisonment. A non-Saudi convicted of money laundering shall be deported from the country after the execution of the sentence. The penalty of the crime of money laundering may be reduced if the perpetrator reports the crime to the competent authorities before they find out, or has reported the perpetrators and his report leads to their arrest or seizure of funds, instrumentalities or proceeds of the crime.​

In the coming weeks NatWest, one of Britain’s largest lenders, is set to appear in court in London to respond to charges that it failed to properly scrutinise a gold-dealing client that deposited £365m ($502m) with the bank—£264m of it in cash.Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Listen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNatWest (which has said it is co-operating with investigators) is the latest lender to be accused of falling short in the fight against dirty money. Last year global banks were hit with $10.4bn in fines for money-laundering violations, an increase of more than 80% on 2019, according to Fenergo, a compliance-software firm. In January Capital One, an American bank, was fined $390m for failing to report thousands of fishy transactions. Danske Bank is still dealing with the fallout of a scandal that erupted in 2018. Over $200bn of potentially dirty money was washed through the Danish lender’s Estonian branch while executives missed or ignored a sea of red flags.These cases imply that banks remain the Achilles heel in the global war on money-laundering, despite the reams of regulations aimed at turning them into frontline soldiers in that conflict. However, closer examination suggests that the global anti-money-laundering (AML) system has serious structural flaws, largely because governments have outsourced to the private sector much of the policing they should have been doing themselves.A study published last year by Ronald Pol, a financial-crime expert, concluded that the global AML system could be “the world’s least effective policy experiment”, and that compliance costs for banks and other businesses could be more than 100 times higher than the amount of laundered loot seized. A report based on a survey of professionals, published last year by LexisNexis, an analytics firm, found that worldwide spending on AML and sanctions compliance by financial institutions (including fund managers, insurers and others, as well as banks) exceeds $180bn a year.Money-laundering was not even a crime across much of the world until the 1980s. Since then countries from Afghanistan to Zambia have been arm-twisted, particularly by America, into passing laws. The effort intensified after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the passage of America’s Patriot Act, which targeted money trails financing terrorism and other crime.AML compliance has since become a huge part of what banks do and created large new bureaucracies. It is not unusual for firms such as HSBC or JPMorgan Chase to have 3,000-5,000 specialists focused on fighting financial crime, and more than 20,000 overall in risk and compliance.The AML push has succeeded in stamping out the most pernicious practices, such as using shell banks (those with no real customers) in sunny places to launder suitcases stuffed with drug money. But criminals have not been forced to get particularly creative: it is not much more difficult today than it was 20 years ago to rinse dirty money by setting up a shell company, disguising the loot flowing through it as legitimate revenue and persuading an established bank to process it.As a result, the numbers tell of a war being lost. The “Global Threat Assessment”, a report by John Cusack, an ex-chair of the Wolfsberg Group, an association of banks that helps develop AML standards, estimates that $5.8trn-worth of financial crime was perpetrated in 2018—equivalent to 6.7% of global GDP. Statistics on how much is intercepted by authorities are patchy. A decade-old estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime put it at just 0.2% of the total. In 2016 Europol estimated the confiscation rate in Europe to be a higher but still paltry 1.1%.Some experts think the success rate may have fallen in recent years, in part because of the rise of “trade-based money-laundering”—which moves dodgy money into the legitimate economy by playing tricks with paperwork for cross-border trade. The covid-19 pandemic, too, has boosted opportunities for financial ne’er-do-wells. Criminals have set up shell companies to exploit vast, poorly policed government-aid schemes. In Britain, the authorities have received more than 50,000 reports of potential misuse of its “Bounce Back Loans” and furlough schemes.Shell shockThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental body that sets global AML standards, admits to problems with the system. Last October its president, Marcus Pleyer, accused the “vast majority” of countries of failing to tackle money-laundering. Some countries have been able to achieve solid marks in the organisation’s assessments by passing nice-looking AML laws, only to water them down later or fail to implement key provisions. One offender is the United Arab Emirates, where weak enforcement has helped Dubai become a haven for corrupt capital. But America and Britain also look to game the FATF process, albeit less egregiously.Global efforts to stamp out money-laundering have, if anything, waned over the past five years, says Robert Barrington of the University of Sussex. In 2016 David Cameron, Britain’s then prime minister, hosted a global anti-corruption summit, and other governments queued up to back the cause. But it proved a false dawn. Britain became distracted by Brexit. In America, President Donald Trump showed scant leadership on the issue. China and Russia have stymied attempts to co-ordinate action against corruption.Three big problems hobble the fight against financial crime: a lack of transparency; a lack of collaboration; and a lack of resources. Start with transparency. Investigators often struggle to identify the real, “beneficial”, owners of shell companies, who often hide behind legal nominees.Some progress has been made in increasing visibility. Britain launched a public register of company owners in 2016, spurring several others to follow suit. Britain’s offshore satellites, such as the British Virgin Islands and Jersey, have been pressed into setting up registers or strengthening existing ones. America recently passed a law requiring ownership data on firms registered at state level, including in Delaware’s incorporation factories, to be held in a federal register.However, many countries still eschew registers, and those that have them have faced problems. In Britain criminals have been willing to risk filing false information, or none at all, given the modest penalties for doing so. Hong Kong, meanwhile, plans to scale back the details company owners must disclose on its register.The FATF is seeking to toughen its standard on beneficial-ownership transparency; the current version says merely that “competent authorities” should have access to such information “in a timely fashion”. But getting its 39 core members—from America and the EU to China and Russia—to agree on a new text will be difficult.The second problem, lack of collaboration, hobbles governments’ work with each other, and with banks on the front line. The big money-laundering schemes are sophisticated and transnational, while anti-laundering efforts remain balkanised. Information-sharing between governments is improving, thanks to co-operation among “financial-intelligence units”, national centres that collect data on suspicious transactions. But the “mutual legal assistance” system, which countries investigating crimes use to request information from each other, is clunky.As for data flowing to and from banks, the benefits of sharing are indisputable. “The value of information coming from a network of banks is thousands of times higher than the information any one bank has, because you can see not just where the money came from, but where it went, and where it went from there, and so on,” says the head of a large international bank. Unfortunately, the level of collaboration is “terrible”. America does best, thanks to the Patriot Act, but even there information-sharing is “on a tiny scale”. Anything more requires a warrant from a judge, “which is hard if you don’t know what the crime is yet”. Britain is in second place, he says, with “about 30%” of the data-sharing done in America. And in third place? “No one.”A daunting obstacle to sharing information is data-privacy laws, which in many places prevent banks from passing information to authorities, particularly foreign ones. Some big banks have lobbied for exceptions to be made for AML, but “governments don’t see it as a legislative priority”, says an executive at another bank.The third difficulty, a dearth of resources, stems from the fact that white-collar crime is less visible than violent crime. Spending on curbing the latter goes down better with the public. In Britain, fraud makes up more than a third of reported crime, yet gets less than 1% of police resources in terms of officers. Banks can spend all they like on AML, but the criminals won’t end up in court if governments fail to invest in policing and prosecution.Many crime-fighting agencies lack the funding to properly analyse the torrent of “suspicious-activity reports” (SARS) banks file when they spot potentially dodgy transactions. SARs are a cornerstone of the system. But banks file too many low-quality or unnecessary reports because they are incentivised to cover their backs rather than to apply sensible risk criteria. Globally they file millions of SARs a year; in America alone, about 1.2m were submitted by deposit-takers last year (see chart).Red-tape revolutionIf the AML system is to be fit for purpose, then governments must work harder together. “Blaming banks for not ‘properly’ implementing [AML] laws is a convenient fiction,” Mr Pol’s report concluded. It also gives an unfair pass to the non-bank actors that enable corruption. While fines for banks with poor AML controls have risen relentlessly, lawyers who set up dodgy shell companies, accountants who sign off on their fishy filings and the like have been getting away with slaps on the wrist. Britain’s revenues and customs agency, for instance, supervises more than 30,000 accountants, estate agents and other businesses for money-laundering purposes; in the 2019-20 financial year it issued just 31 fines, averaging £290,000. Governments also need to get to grips with the AML implications of cryptocurrencies, and the firms and exchanges that hawk them.Activists who campaign to fix the cracks in the global AML architecture are pinning much hope on the Biden administration, which has said that it views the fight against corruption as a national-security issue and therefore a priority. Whether it can work more profitably than its predecessor with Europe, which is overhauling AML oversight in the wake of the Danske debacle, remains to be seen. Hopes that China can be persuaded to co-operate are not high. Either way, bankers should probably brace for another beating. ■A version of this article appeared online on April 12th, 2021.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""Losing the war""Reuse this contentThe Trust ProjectMore from Finance & economicsToo much of a good thingAre labour markets in the rich world too tight?Looking in the side-mirrorOmicron is dealing a big blow to China’s economyA little help from a friendAmerica’s gas frackers limber up to save EuropeDiversionary tacticsWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?Side channelsIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketMore from Finance & economicsAre labour markets in the rich world too tight?Certainly in America, and probably elsewhereOmicron is dealing a big blow to China’s economyFor a timely take, analysts are turning to unconventional indicatorsAmerica’s gas frackers limber up to save EuropeThere might be little they can do in the short termAre labour markets in the rich world too tight?Certainly in America, and probably elsewhereOmicron is dealing a big blow to China’s economyFor a timely take, analysts are turning to unconventional indicatorsAmerica’s gas frackers limber up to save EuropeThere might be little they can do in the short termWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketThe question is how to pay for Russian oilSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentThe Trust ProjectHelp and contact usKeep updatedFacebookInstagramTwitterLinkedInYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreStoreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist EventsWorking HereWhich MBA?GMAT TutorGRE TutorExecutive JobsExecutive Education NavigatorExecutive Education: The New Global OrderExecutive Education: Business WritingTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCopyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2022.

Sentences for money laundering getting longer: research

Immediate custodial sentences for money laundering and other regulatory breaches are getting longer, making compliance increasingly important for business.




New research by Thomson Reuters showed the average length of prison sentences handed down to people convicted of money laundering had risen from 20.5 months to 27 months between 2008 and 2018.
The increasing use of custodial sentences is likely to make companies focus on compliance with regulations. 
In the past few years the UK government has introduced a number of measures designed to reduce money laundering, including a register of beneficial ownership for UK companies and the use of unexplained wealth orders (UWOs). 
Sentencing guidelines introduced in October 2014 gave English and Welsh judges guidance on the sentencing of bribery and money laundering offences for the first time and were designed to encourage a consistent approach to the sentencing of these offences. 
UWOs were introduced in January 2018 and require individuals to explain where their wealth has come from. Bodies such as HM Revenue & Customs, the Serious Fraud Office and the National Crime Agency have the ability to apply to the High Court for a UWO to freeze and forfeit funds in bank and building society accounts.
The Thomson Reuters research, reported by the Financial Times (subscription required) also said fines for money laundering offences were now less common. In 2013 fines were handed down in 13% of money laundering cases, but this had dropped to 7% last year. 
The harm caused by economic crime is well documented and the UK government has been consistent in its determination to make it as difficult as possible for criminal proceeds to be laundered through the UK, with the introduction of tools such as UWOs and the register of beneficial ownership, with further reforms on the horizon as loopholes are closed. 
An effective deterrent depends not just on legislation and regulation, however, but on effective, consistent and transparent enforcement. The courts have the tools for this and, as we have seen with other regulatory breaches - for example, in health and safety and environmental matters - are increasingly using them to their full force to bring home the message that misconduct will not be tolerated. Immediate custodial sentences are no longer reserved for the most flagrant breaches and are becoming increasingly commonplace for a variety of regulatory misdemeanours. With such high stakes at play, compliance issues cannot be ignored.
The EU’s 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which was published in November last year and comes into force in December 2020 across the EU, proposed an increase in the minimum prison sentence for money laundering offences for individuals from one year to four years, alongside a variety of other ‘dissuasive’ sanctions. Conviction on indictment in the UK allows imprisonment for longer than this already.

    Two-Year Treasury Yield Climbs Above 10-Year Again
  
Bond yields move higher as March employment report shows wages continue to rise

 















Labor Department data show that the economy added 431,000 jobs in March.

          Updated April 1, 2022 3:58 pm ET
        











Yields on U.S. government bonds climbed Friday, aided by a strong jobs report, after a burst of quarter-end buying had driven them lower in recent sessions.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled at 2.374%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 2.324% Thursday.
 Short-term Treasury yields rose more than longer-term yields, reflecting expectations that the Fed could start raising its benchmark federal-funds rate in half-percentage-point increments in coming meetings in an effort to tame inflation.
The two-year yield settled at 2.430%, compared with 2.284% Thursday. It was the first time the two-year yield closed above the 10-year yield since 2019, a sign investors think the Fed could start cutting rates in response to slowing economic growth not long after it has finished raising them.


Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed in the overnight session. Shorter-term yields, especially, then took another leg upward after data from the Labor Department showed that the economy added 431,000 jobs in March and that average hourly earnings increased 0.4% from the previous month.
Bond investors have been particularly focused on wage gains, which can be a long-term driver of overall inflation. The data for March showed that wages are still climbing at a rapid clip, returning to trend after they were reported to be nearly flat in the previous data release.
“Overall, this is an extremely consensus payrolls report that will keep the Fed on track” to raise rates by half a percentage point at its May meeting, Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients.
Friday’s trading suggested that a tough period for bond investors may not be over after they got a reprieve in recent sessions—with the 10-year yield declining after reaching 2.5% in intraday trading on March 25.
Despite the last-minute rally, bonds still suffered their worst quarter in four decades, thanks to continued high inflation and escalating expectations for how much the Fed could tighten monetary policy over the next two years.
The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate bond index—largely U.S. Treasurys, highly rated corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities—returned minus 5.9% over the first three months of the year, its biggest quarterly loss since 1980.











          An inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve has been seen as a recession warning sign for decades, and it looks like it’s about to light up again. WSJ’s Dion Rabouin explains why an inverted yield curve can be so reliable in predicting recession and why market watchers are talking about it now. Illustration: Ryan Trefes

          Convicted money launderer who smuggled millions out of the UK wanted by the NCA        




            Money laundering          



The NCA is appealing for information on the whereabouts of a convicted money launderer who talked of moving up to £50 million out of the UK every month.
Abdul Fahad, 41, of Meads Lane, Ilford, was arrested by NCA officers in 2018 after bundles of cash totalling more than £100,000 were found in his car.

He was charged with multiple money laundering offences after further cash was located at his home, alongside evidence of frequent and suspicious trips to the United Arab Emirates.
Fahad initially told NCA officers that the cash seized had come from life savings, and from the sale of property and stocks.
He also stated he was a sole trader dealing in cars and that he intended to pay the money into a bank to buy a car.
However, the investigation found that Fahad was in regular contact with Sathar Khan, a money launderer jailed in 2018 for attempting to board a flight to Dubai with almost £1.5 million pounds cash in his suitcases.
Officers recovered messages from Fahad’s phone, showing a handwritten note detailing a schedule of dates for travel to Dubai between himself and Khan.
Between 2017 and 2018, the two men made nearly 200 return flights with both frequently travelling out with a significantly greater weight of luggage than they returned with.
NCA investigators estimate that Fahad left the UK with an extra 379 kilos over the offending period, which would equate to around £5 million in cash.
Messages on Fahad’s phone also detailed conversations with another would-be cash courier, with one message reading: “Giv me some work too… so I can earn too.’
Further messages revealed that Fahad and Khan discussed sending two couriers per day on money laundering runs during July and August 2018.
Money laundering experts estimate that, if successful, this may have seen up to £50 million moved out of the UK in the period.
Fahad appeared before Southwark Crown Court in September this year, where he pleaded guilty to three money laundering charges. He was granted bail but later absconded.
He was sentenced in his absence to eight years in prison on 16 December.
Law enforcement partners in the UAE provided valuable assistance to the NCA investigation.
Jason Hulme, Operations Manager at the National Crime Agency said:
“Fahad was at the heart of a multi-million-pound money laundering conspiracy, moving cash which would have been derived from serious and organised crime in the UK and internationally.
“We are seeking information on his whereabouts in order that he is made to serve his prison sentence. We believe he could be in East London, particularly around the Ilford or East Ham area and has connections to Dubai and Sri Lanka.
“Anyone with information should report to the NCA Control Centre on 0370 496 7622 quoting Operation Blissless or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”

Why get a student credit card
Apr 01, 11:04
One way to manage your child's expenses, when she is ready for college, is to give her cash or monthly pocket money. Now banks such as SBI Card, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank offer another option--credit cards for college students. As a parent, you could apply for it against an education loan or an add-on card to one you already have, or against a fixed deposit. Students above the age of 18 are eligible. Documents required include college id, PAN card and personal id proof. Experts say that such cards are useful for students traveling abroad who can structure their payments better, and for parents who can  monitor their expenses.

Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesBen ButlerTue 1 Mar 2022 01.08 GMTLast modified on Tue 1 Mar 2022 01.10 GMTAustrac has launched court action accusing James Packer’s Crown Resorts of breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws and continuing to contravene the law due to wholly inadequate oversight by management.In a lawsuit filed with the federal court on Tuesday, Austrac, Australia’s financial intelligence agency, said ongoing failures to properly vet risky customers – including those brought in from overseas by junket operators and locals with links to people already banned from Crown’s Melbourne and Perth casinos – accounted for 547 breaches of anti-money laundering laws.Crown Resorts agrees to $9bn takeover by BlackstoneRead moreEach alleged breach of the law if proven could attract a penalty of up to $22.2m, meaning Crown faces a fine that could theoretically exceed $12bn. However, if Austrac’s action succeeds, a far smaller penalty is likely. The current record fine is $1.3bn, which Westpac agreed to pay to settle allegations by Austrac that the bank breached AML/CTF laws more than 23m times, including by allowing a dozen customers to transfer money to the Philippines in a way consistent with child exploitation.From March 2016, just 60 high-risk customers turned over $70bn at Crown’s casinos, pumping $1.1bn in losses into the company’s coffers, Austrac said in a concise statement filed with the court.Austrac alleges that Crown failed to do appropriate due diligence on these customers, which it said included junket operators and players, foreign politically exposed people – a category that can include government officials and their families – as well as people who had been arrested for money laundering or were suspected of being “connected to organised crime”.The regulator alleges that “many engaged in large cash transactions and transacted with cash that appeared suspicious, including cash in plastic bags, shoeboxes or cardboard boxes, cash in rubber bands, small denominations of notes and counterfeit cash”.James Packer admits to ‘many oversights’ at Perth Crown casino during royal commission hearingRead moreIt alleges that an additional 447 customers engaged in transactions that Crown’s external consultants later identified as typical of money laundering or terrorism finance.Some customers allegedly engaged in multiple breaches.The legal action follows an investigation that Austrac’s chief executive, Nicole Rose, said showed that Crown failed to put in place and maintain an AML/CTF program that would mitigate the risk that its casinos were misused for money laundering.“They also failed to carry out appropriate ongoing customer due diligence including on some very high-risk customers,” she said.“This led to widespread and serious non-compliance over a number of years.“Austrac has taken this strong action to achieve enduring change and ensure that Crown will fully meet their obligations to protect themselves and Australia’s financial system from criminal activity.”She said Crown was working to improve its systems, “however there is further work to do and Austrac will continue to work closely with Crown to address ongoing compliance concerns”.Crown said it was reviewing the statement of claim filed with the court by Austrac.Crown Resorts: can a ‘special manager’ clean up Melbourne’s casino?Read moreIt said it “has developed a comprehensive remediation plan which is intended to position Crown as a leader in the industry in its approach to governance, compliance, responsible gaming and the management of financial crime risk”.“The plan is underpinned by an uplifted organisational culture.”Allegations that Crown’s casinos were being used for money laundering were made by Nine Entertainment’s newspapers and its flagship current affairs TV show, 60 Minutes, in 2019.Inquiries in both NSW and Victoria found that Crown facilitated money laundering at its Melbourne and Perth casinos and that some junket operators were linked to organised crime.

Find out more on these stories below. ‍Ex-chief of Swedbank charged over Baltic money laundering scandal Sweden’s Economic Crime Authority (ECA) has charged former Swedbank CEO Birgitte Bonnesen with several financial crimes, including fraud.  In announcing the charges, ECA chief prosecutor Thomas Langrot noted that the embattled Ms Bonnesen, who was fired by Swedbank in early 2019, had either deliberately or negligently circulated grossly inaccurate information about the inadequate AML performance of the organisation in its Baltic operations. Qualifying his decision, Mr Langrot said there was evidence of a “cover-up” of money laundering problems at Swedbank. In a report commissioned by the bank in 2020, it was found that €37bn (£30bn) worth of transactions carrying a high risk of money laundering were carried out in the Baltic region during the period of 2014 to 2019.  However, since the findings, the bank has stated they’ve taken a number of actions “to remedy shortcomings and ensure a sustainable corporate governance in Swedbank,” and under new management, has “strengthened its anti-money laundering work and compliance with the international sanctions’ regulations.”  Speaking in defence of Ms Bonnesen, her lawyer, expressed confidence in her innocence and likely acquittal, stating that it is “important to see that the prosecutor is not saying she did anything for her own benefit. She has not bought or sold one single share.” Read more on this story at The Guardian.‍Mexican authorities jail ex-political chief pending sex-trafficking trial A Mexican judge  this week granted a request by prosecutors to hold the ex-leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), Mr Cuauhtémoc Gutiérrez de la Torre, in jail pending trial on charges of sex-trafficking. The accusations against Mr Gutiérrez de la Torre, consist of four counts of attempted human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation and stem from 2014, when he was accused on the radio news show Noticias MVS of links to a prostitution ring.  The broadcast made the allegations after a journalist’s undercover sting operation claimed that his office recruited “female personnel to work in government offices” through newspaper adverts. The sting recorded recruiters allegedly informing potential candidates that they would have to have sex with Mr Gutiérrez de la Torre if they were hired. Although prosecutors did not pursue the charges due to lack of evidence at the time and Mr Gutiérrez de la Torre strenuously denied the allegations, the IRP removed him from his post immediately. The charges were later re-instated, and he was arrested on 29 December 2021 after Mexico’s AML regulators froze his bank accounts.

The arrests were the culmination of a two-month long investigation into criminal misuse of the platform. The police probe spanned 11 of Turkey’s provinces, and as many as 2400 streamers are thought to have been involved in the scam. The large-scale, well-organised money laundering operation involved hackers buying up millions in Twitch Bits - the site’s virtual currency - using stolen credit cards. The Bits were then donated to willing streamers, some of whom claimed to be unaware that they were engaged in a crime, who refunded about 80% to the scammers, taking a 20% cut for themselves.  The money laundering scandal was first exposed in late-October 2021, with many more civic-minded Turkish Twitch users vocalising their dismay and anger on social media platforms. A probe was quickly instigated by Turkey’s Chief Prosecutor’s Office, resulting in this week’s arrests. Four suspected gang members are still at large, while some of those detained are believed to be minors.

NatWest fined £264.8 million for anti-money laundering failures 





 









NatWest fined £264.8 million for anti-money laundering failures

National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) was today fined £264,772,619.95 following convictions for three offences of failing to comply with money laundering regulations.




Mrs Justice Cockerill, the sentencing judge at Southwark Crown Court, today said: '….it must be borne in mind that although in no way complicit in the money laundering which took place, the Bank was functionally vital. Without the Bank – and without the Bank’s failures - the money could not be effectively laundered.' 
NatWest pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates Court on 7 October. This is the first time the FCA has pursued criminal charges for money laundering failings.
The charges covered NatWest’s failure to properly monitor the activity of a commercial customer, Fowler Oldfield, a jewellery business based in Bradford, between 8 November 2012 to 23 June 2016. When taking on the customer, NatWest initially understood it would not handle cash from the Fowler Oldfield business. However, over the course of the customer relationship approximately £365m was deposited with the bank, of which around £264m was in cash.
Some of the bank’s employees, who were responsible for handling these cash deposits, reported their suspicions to bank staff responsible for investigating suspected money laundering, however no appropriate action was ever taken. The ‘red flags’ that were reported included significant amounts of Scottish bank notes deposited throughout England, deposits of notes carrying a prominent musty smell, and individuals acting suspiciously when depositing cash in NatWest branches. In addition, the bank’s automated transaction monitoring system incorrectly recognised some cash deposits as cheque deposits. As cheques carry a lower money laundering risk than cash, this was a significant gap in the bank’s monitoring of a large number of customers depositing cash, of which Fowler Oldfield was one.
A separate investigation by West Yorkshire Police has led to 11 people pleading guilty to charges relating to the cash deposits and three cash couriers being charged. A further 13 individuals are awaiting trial at Leeds Crown Court on 25 April 2022 in relation to the activities of Fowler Oldfield.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
'NatWest is responsible for a catalogue of failures in the way it monitored and scrutinised transactions that were self-evidently suspicious. Combined with serious systems failures, like the treatment of cash deposits as cheques, these failures created an open door for money laundering.
'Anti-money laundering controls are a vital part of the fight against serious crime, like drug trafficking, and such failures are intolerable ones that let down the whole community, which, in this case, justified the FCA’s first criminal prosecution under the Money Laundering Regulations.'
Notes to editors
The fine reflected a discount for the plea of guilty. The figure before 1/3 reduction for plea is £397,156,944.14.
Sentencing remarks: 
NatWest failed to comply with Money Laundering Regulations (2007). The Money Laundering Regulations 2007 came into force on 15 December 2007 and form part of the UK’s legislative framework designed to prevent the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. They were superseded by the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017. 
Full details of the case against NatWest are available in the following agreed Statement of Facts  
National Westminster Bank Plc is a subsidiary of NatWest Group Plc (formerly the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Man Sentenced to 46 Months in Prison for Firearm Offenses
An Alabama man was sentenced today to 46 months in prison for federal and local firearms offenses stemming from the discovery of weapons in his pickup truck parked near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
Lonnie Leroy Coffman, 72, of Falkville, Alabama, was sentenced today to 46 months in prison after pleading guilty to federal and local firearms offenses stemming from the discovery of weapons in his pickup truck parked near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
According to court documents, Coffman traveled from Alabama to the District of Columbia several days prior to Jan. 6, 2021. He parked his red GMC Sierra pickup truck in the 300 block of First Street SE, on the morning of Jan. 6. Less than half a mile away in the U.S. Capitol Building, a joint session of the U.S. Congress was scheduled to meet in the afternoon to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the presidential election.
Coffman admitted in his plea agreement that he exited the pickup truck at 9:20 a.m. and walked in the direction of the U.S. Capitol Building, and towards a rally near the National Mall. Inside the pickup truck were several loaded firearms within arms-reach of the driver’s seat, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, a crossbow with bolts, machetes, camouflage smoke devices, a stun gun, and a cooler containing 11 mason jars filled with ignitable ingredients for Molotov cocktail incendiary weapons. Coffman also carried a loaded handgun and a loaded revolver as he walked around the area that day. A search of Coffman’s residence in Alabama later that month led to the discovery of 12 additional mason jars containing ignitable substances, each constituting the component parts of Molotov cocktails.
Coffman did not have a license to carry a pistol in the District of Columbia and had not registered any firearms or destructive devices in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, as required by law.
Coffman has been in custody since his arrest on Jan. 6, 2021. Coffman will be placed on three years of supervised release following his prison term.
Coffman was sentenced in the District of Columbia by the Honorable Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in two separate criminal cases, one brought in the District of Columbia on Jan. 7, 2021, and the other brought in the Northern District of Alabama and transferred to the District of Columbia for purposes of plea and sentencing. Coffman had pleaded guilty on Nov. 12, 2021, to two counts of possession of an unregistered firearm, a federal offense, regarding the component parts of Molotov cocktails discovered in his pickup truck in Washington, D.C., and at his residence in Alabama. Coffman also pleaded guilty to carrying a pistol without a license, a District of Columbia offense. Judge Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him to 46 months in prison on each of the federal offenses, and 15 months on the District of Columbia offense, with the time running concurrently.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Friedman for the District of Columbia and Henry Cornelius for the Northern District of Alabama prosecuted the case, with valuable assistance provided by Trial Attorney Taryn Meeks of the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section.
The case was investigated by the FBI’s Birmingham and Washington Field Offices, and the U.S. Capitol Police.

A Swiss criminal court was opening a trial Monday, Feb. 7, 2022, on charges that Credit Suisse failed to do enough to stop money laundering linked to drug trafficking by a Bulgarian criminal organization, which employed a wrestler who once hauled millions in currency by car to Switzerland. (Walter Bieri/Keystone via AP, File)GENEVA -- A Swiss criminal court was opening a trial Monday on charges that Credit Suisse failed to do enough to stop money laundering linked to drug trafficking by a Bulgarian criminal organization, which employed a wrestler who once hauled millions in currency by car to Switzerland.The case against the bank in federal criminal court, in the southern city of Bellinzona, centers on charges that it “did not take all necessary measures to halt the infraction of money laundering"" by one of its employees, according to a summary from the court announcing the start to the proceedings.As per Swiss criminal court cases, the defendants — both individual and corporate — were not named to protect their privacy. But Swiss prosecutors identified Credit Suisse by name in an indictment announced in December 2020.The indictment, which centered on a former manager at the Swiss bank and two members of the criminal ring, wrapped up a yearslong investigation into allegations of wrongdoing that appears mostly to have taken place between 2004 and 2008.“Credit Suisse unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it and is convinced that its former employee is innocent,” the Swiss bank said in a statement Monday, adding that it “will defend itself vigorously in court.”The Swiss attorney general’s office noted how top-level athletes in Bulgaria, after the fall of communism, “turned towards other sources of income, and numerous wrestlers received approaches from mafia clans.” One unidentified wrestler aimed to cash in by trafficking tons of cocaine through “mules” from South America to Europe by air and sea and then laundering the profits.The proceeds from the drug sales, often in small denomination notes, entered Swiss bank accounts from 2004 to at least 2007 and were used to buy real estate in Bulgaria and Switzerland in particular.The wrestler’s “main offense was committed in February 2006, when he transported the equivalent of more than 4 million Swiss francs in small denomination notes hidden in his car from Barcelona to Switzerland,” prosecutors said in their indictment.A former Credit Suisse executive in charge of business relations with the criminal organization carried out transactions for the ring despite ""strong indications that the funds were of criminal origin,” prosecutors said.The executive, who was not identified, is accused of preventing the identification of the origin of the funds, which ultimately involved transactions of more than 140 million Swiss francs (about $150 million).The bank has consistently rejected the allegations and has said the court could order the “disgorgement of profits” and a maximum fine of about $5 million.Comments (0)Share to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this articleTop StoriesRussia-Ukraine live updates: 'Women were raped and killed in front of their children'30 minutes agoSecret Service paying over $30K per month for Malibu mansion to protect Hunter BidenApr 04, 4:54 AM3 Republicans explain why they're breaking ranks to vote for Ketanji Brown Jackson2 hours agoNew COVID-19 variant XE identified: What you should knowApr 05, 4:04 AMOklahoma state House approves bill to make abortion illegal3 hours agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour CA Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsCopyright © 2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.

31st Jan 2022
The biggest fraud and money laundering cases




 





Share





 



Money laundering and fraud can have a severe impact on everyone from regular citizens to multinational corporations. In fact, the National Crime Agency puts the cost of money laundering and fraud to British businesses, citizens and government at over £190 billion a year[1].As you might expect, there have been some extraordinary examples of these crimes over the years. We have analysed 10 of the most lucrative (and shocking!) cases, to reveal exactly what happened and how businesses and individuals can learn from these cases moving into 2020:1.	‘Mr Big’ After serving a three-year prison sentence for laundering drug money[2], Maythem Al-Ansari, aka ‘Mr Big’, was staring down the barrel of an additional jail term for a mortgage fraud that cost millions of pounds. However, after handing over his passport as part of the bail terms, an error allowed Al-Ansari to acquire another passport from the Home Office, which he used to flee to Syria. Eventually Mr Big gave himself up at London Heathrow in 2016, but the blunder was highly embarrassing at the time and left millions of pounds unaccounted for. Of course, this was a high profile case and this kind of error rarely occurs, but it highlights the necessity of government bodies to continue working closely together to avoid lapses in communication that allow such issues to happen. 2.	Largest ever visa fraud in the UKFour people were sentenced in September 2019 at Southwark Crown Court[3] for being behind the UK’s largest ever visa and immigration fraud case. The culprits impersonated ‘immigration advisors’ who charged extortionate fees for compiling (false) immigration applications that would’ve cost millions of pounds to the British taxpayer had the scam come off. It’s imperative that those looking to migrate to the United Kingdom only go through the proper, official channels to avoid any chance of being defrauded. 3.	Failings at Standard Chartered Bank For a vast series of failings including opening a bank account with 3 million UAE Dirham (£500,000) deposited from cash in a suitcase, the Financial Conduct Authority issued its second-largest fine[4] to Standard Chartered Bank in April 2019 of just over £102 million.Businesses, particularly those in the banking and financial sector, must take an active approach in identifying money laundering risks and reporting these without hesitation to the relevant authorities. Complying with money laundering legislation will save companies money in the long run as any fines for breaches would eclipse resulting fines. 4.	The worst female fraudster in the UKAptly dubbed by police as the “UK’s most prolific female fraudster”[5], Maria Michaela scammed banks out of £13 million by submitting offers on houses over the market value and then defaulting on the mortgages. Michaela was able to repeat this several times by using false identities.This highlights how important it is that mortgage lenders take a close, critical look at offers that come in well over the asking price. Many offers of this nature will be genuine, but sometimes they are too good to be true. 5.	Luxury accessories, 500 lottery tickets and even bars of gold Police tracked a series of dubious purchases by Stephen Burton, before raiding his home in February 2019[6], uncovering a vast collection of possessions with a value of almost £1 million. These included solid gold bars, designer watches, thousands of pounds and euros, 500 lottery tickets and false identities. Police were able to ‘follow the money’ in this case, as purchases that are beyond the means of ‘average citizens’ are often indicators that fraudulent behaviour is taking place. 6.	Suitcase smugglingIn November 2019[7], police arrested ten suspected members of an organised crime gang, under suspicion of smuggling £15.5 million pounds out of the UK to Dubai in suitcases.This is another example of the authorities building a case around suspected illegal activity, in this instance unusual travel patterns and living well above one’s means, and acting upon their investigations. 7.	Big-time benefit fraud Following the death of her father in 2004, Ethel McGill[8] continued to claim his war pension and benefits by claiming he was still alive, at one point convincing a friend to lay down under a blanket to impersonate Mr Dennison.  McGill also faked disability and dementia for over two decades but investigators at the Department for Work and Pensions acquired videos of her driving and moving around, despite her claims of needing a wheelchair. Everyday people are often able to help in cases like this, so if you know about a fraudulent situation then reporting it to the relevant authorities can really help. 8.	Bank of Scotland’s scandalHundreds of people were left in serious financial difficulty due to rogue employees at Bank of Scotland’s (HBOS) Reading branch colluding with consultants to defraud small businesses of around £245 million between 2003 and 2007[9].The scam involved referring small businesses to a ‘turnaround consultancy’, which would convince the businesses they needed help, before loading them with astronomical debts and fees. For failing to disclose information about the activity, HBOS was fined over £45 million.Small businesses should always proceed with caution when being passed over to outside consultancies without seeking their own, independent advice. 9.	Four cases and lots of cash In 2019 Mohamed Imran Khan Sathar Khan, then 36, was caught by Border Force operatives trying to smuggle £1.5 million in four suitcases to Dubai[10]. Each case weighed exactly 20kg, which savvy border guards were able to recognise as suspicious before searching the cases and rumbling the fraudster.This is a great example of authorities spotting a strange pattern and acting on their suspicions. With such situations, it is always better to be safe than sorry.  10.	Huge fine for Commonwealth Bank In 2018 Australia’s largest lender, Commonwealth Bank, agreed to pay a whopping £400 million fine[11], the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history, for breach of anti money laundering and counter-terror financing legislation. In total, there were 53,000 suspicious transactions that weren’t reported to the relevant authorities by the bank. According to Commonwealth, this was due to a coding error preventing the automatic reporting of transactions that may be indicative of illegal activity. Companies in the financial and banking sectors should continually monitor and proactively troubleshoot their software to ensure it is recording data and reporting accurately and efficiently, or else risk being faced with huge fines and repercussions.Here we have picked out just ten of the most high-profile examples of money laundering and fraud, but these are the tip of the iceberg. These cases are continuously occurring and those that are on a smaller scale most likely won’t make the news. The size of the problem is enormous, costing British citizens, businesses and government hundreds of billions of pounds each year. Looking at prominent cases does serve a purpose in that it highlights the issue and can raise awareness of money laundering and fraud, and may help businesses understand how to better protect themselves against such crimes. To find out more on how SmartSearch can help your business, please visit: https://www.smartsearch.com/product/overviewReferences: [1]https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/national-economic-crime-centre-leads-push-to-identify-money-laundering-activity[2]https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/criminal-mr-big-on-run-with-10m-after-disastrous-passport-blunder-8209073.html [3]https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/four-sentenced-their-part-uks-largest-ever-visa-fraud[4]https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-standard-chartered-bank-102-2-million-poor-aml-controls [5]https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20273687 [6]https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/money-launderer-500-lotto-tickets-20791827[7]https://news.sky.com/story/ten-arrested-in-london-after-15m-smuggled-from-uk-to-dubai-hidden-in-suitcases-11865936 [8]https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/one-of-britain-s-biggest-benefit-cheats-is-jailed-for-740-000-fraud-6fcqf8cp9# [9]https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/bank-of-scotland-fined-by-regulator-over-reading-fraud [10]https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/money-launderer-tried-to-flee-uk-with-15m-cash-stuffed-in-suitcases-a4124801.html [11]https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-44351257

FCA secures criminal conviction of NatWest for money laundering breaches
Posted on 8 October 2021


















On 7 October at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, NatWest entered guilty pleas to three counts of failure to prevent money laundering under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (MLR 2007). The charges were brought by the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'). The bank admitted it failed to comply with regulation 8(1) between 7 November 2013 until 23 June 2016, and regulations 8(3) and 14(1) between 8 November 2012 and 23 June 2016, in relation to the accounts of a UK incorporated customer.
The UK customer was Yorkshire-based gold dealership Fowler Oldfield Ltd. Between 7 November 2013 and 23 June 2016, Flower Oldfield deposited £365 million into its NatWest accounts, £264 million of which was in cash. Flower Oldfield subsequently shut down after police raided their premises in 2016.
The case has been sent to Southwark Crown Court for sentencing and the FCA intends to recommend a fine in the region of £340m.
Analysis
This case is noteworthy for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is the first criminal prosecution brought under the MLR 2007 by the FCA. It also confirms the FCA's decision and the wishes of its CEO to become a more  assertive, confident, decisive and agile regulator. This same sentiment was expressed by the FCA's Chairman Charles Randall at the FCA's Annual Public Meeting, which took place on the 28 September, where he stated that the regulator was undertaking a broad programme of change to become a more proactive and assertive regulator. 
The FCA's decision to pursue a criminal prosecution where a civil resolution was available should alert firms to how committed the regulator is to making full use of its powers in cases of tackling wrongdoing. Having already suffered criticism that it was slow to act in previous cases, the FCA has signalled that it will take a strict approach with offending parties in the future. The regulations under which NatWest was prosecuted do not require proof that money laundering has taken place.
The case serves as a reminder of the need for firms to have adequate procedures in place to prevent money laundering, particularly as it relates to ongoing monitoring of customer relationships.  At the outset of its relationship with Fowler Oldfield, it was agreed that NatWest would not handle cash deposits for the dealership, but across the relevant period it nevertheless accepted £264 million in cash. Indeed on one single day the dealership deposited £1.8 million in cash with the bank.
""Adequate risk-based due diligence and monitoring of client relationships must be an ongoing exercise for corporate entities who wish to safeguard themselves in the face of closer regulatory scrutiny and what promises to be an aggressive prosecutorial landscape going forward. Banks and other regulated firms must ensure that their systems are fit for purpose"" - Johanna Walsh, Partner in the White Collar Crime & Investigations Group

					FILE - In this Tuesday Sept. 16, 2008 file photo, American murder suspect Amanda Knox, center, is escorted by Italian penitentiary police officers from Perugia's court after a hearing, central Italy.  Europe's human rights court has ordered Italy to pay Amanda Knox around 18,000 euros ($20,000) in financial damages for police failure to provide legal assistance and a translator during questioning following the Nov. 1, 2007 killing of her British roommate. The European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg, France, on Thursday ruled that Italy must pay Knox 10,400 euros damages plus 8,000 euros for costs and expenses.

Europe’s human rights court on Thursday ordered Italy to pay Amanda Knox financial damages for police failure to provide legal assistance and a translator during a long night of questioning following the Nov. 1, 2007 murder of her British roommate. But the court said there was insufficient evidence to support claims of psychological and physical mistreatment at the hands of police.
The European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg, France, said in its ruling that Italy hadn’t succeeded in proving that “the restriction of Ms. Knox’s access to a lawyer … had not irreparably undermined the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.” It ordered damages that Italy must pay Knox 18,400 euros ($27,000) in damages, costs and expenses.“Ms. Knox had been particularly vulnerable, being a foreign young woman, 20 at the time, not having been in Italy for very long and not being fluent in Italian,” the court noted.

 After more than seven years of legal battles and flip-flop decisions, Knox, now 31, was definitively acquitted of Meredith Kercher’s murder by Italy’s highest court in March 2015, but a damaging conviction for falsely accusing a Congolese bar owner of the murder was confirmed, leaving a cloud over her acquittal.WATCH: Amanda Knox, former boyfriend acquitted of 2007 murder in Italy (2015) It was during questioning in the wee hours of Nov. 6, 2007 that Knox accused Patrick Lumumba, the owner of a bar where she sometimes worked, of the murder. Knox’s defence had long claimed that the accusation was coerced. The court noted she had quickly and repeatedly retracted the statement, citing a hand-written statement on the afternoon of Nov. 6, 2007, another for her lawyers three days later and in a wiretapped call to her mother on Nov. 10, 2007.

 Knox’s defence attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said the decision “is not a big surprise for me because the supreme court already said there were many mistakes. That is one of the reasons that invited us to tell Amanda to go to Strasbourg.”WATCH: Amanda Knox says she is grateful to have her life back (2015) “For me this is a certification of a mistake, probably the biggest legal mistake in the last years in Italy, also because the attention that this case has had,” Dalla Vedova said. He said he was considering whether to challenge the standing conviction for malicious false accusations.“It is impossible to compensate Amanda for four years in prison for a mistake. There will be no amount. We are not looking for compensation of damages. We are doing this on principal,” he said.  Story continues below advertisement

Money Laundering Scandals: The Biggest Money Laundering Stories of 2021




VinciWorks 


23rd December 2021



 



What happened in AML compliance in 2021?
Fines running into the billions and jail terms totalling hundreds of years. AML enforcement has not taken a back seat during the pandemic, with fines, scandals, leaks and sweeping new regulations. The past year has been a blockbuster one for money laundering compliance. Here, we round up the biggest money laundering stories of 2021.

SEB Bank – fit for purpose?
The Swedish bank was fined $170m for AML failures back in 2020, relating to compliance deficiencies in its Baltic operations in the same scandal which ensnared Danske Bank. But this latest scandal doesn’t involve additional wrongdoing by SEB, but rather what their chief executive said about AML compliance programmes in general.
Johan Torgeby questioned if the regulations themselves were ‘fit for purpose,’ given SEB now employs thousands of people in compliance and asks its customers “a humongous amount of questions.” The CEO said that banks are only stopping about 1% of trillions of dollars of criminal cash entering the system, despite collectively spending over $20bn on compliance.
Torgeby praised cooperation between Swedish banks and the national police force however, calling their information sharing programme a much more effective method of stopping criminals than traditional regulatory compliance. 
An AML revolution in the USA
Long taking its own course in money laundering compliance, the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act included sweeping reforms to AML laws in the United States which catch it up to the EU. Among the changes coming into force include requirements for additional beneficial ownership information. This is aimed at eliminating shell companies entirely, requiring companies who do business in the US to disclose detailed information about ultimate beneficial owners.
AML whistleblowers will receive increased protections, and rewards, while companies and individuals will face stiffer penalties for violations of AML rules or the Bank Secrecy Act. Suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports will become easier to submit, and can be more easily shared with foreign governments and regulators. 
Tackling the London Laundromat
Is London a haven for dirty money? The UK Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee seems to think so. The UK and its offshore dependencies such as Jersey or the Cayman Islands are being used as money laundering hubs, costing the UK economy over £100bn per year. Transparency International found nearly 1,000 UK shell companies involved in corruption and money laundering cases.
There’s been increasing calls for the UK government to act on its promise to introduce tougher AML rules, including more stringent beneficial ownership rules. In 2015, then prime minister David Cameron promised to introduce a register of beneficial owners of UK property, but this has still to be brought up in parliament. Secret property ownership in the UK came under significant scrutiny in 2021, with reports from the Pandora Papers showing that the Queen’s estate bought a £67m London property from the Azerbaijani dictator, and further properties sold to the monarch from an offshore company owned by President Aliyev’s 11-year-old son.
Opening Pandora’s filing cabinet
More than 11 million confidential secret documents were exposed in yet another leak of sensitive offshore company details, showing hidden wealth, tax avoidance and money laundering by the world’s rich and powerful. The extensive documents revealed a staggering amount of tax avoidance, particularly through shell companies registered offshore. While much of this is supposedly ‘legal,’ loopholes are being stretched and the public’s patience tested. 
From a money laundering perspective, plenty of jurisdictions take the proceeds of tax evasion as a predicate offence for money laundering. So if rules were broken, illegal cash can be injected into the system. More so, the Pandora Papers showed the soft edge of international finance. If kings and dictators can set up offshore companies to secretly sell and buy millions in property to each other, what’s to stop kingpins and drug lords from doing the same thing? The key lesson in the fight against money laundering is that offshore jurisdictions and shady shell companies absolutely present a red flag. 
Bin bags full of cash at NatWest
In the first criminal prosecution of a financial institution by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Britain’s biggest bank NatWest was fined £264m for system-wide AML failures which allowed enabled black bin liners stuffed with cash to be deposited, literally bursting out of floor-to-ceiling branch safes.
The trial centred on a textbook case of money laundering by a supposed jeweller, Fowler Oldfield. Their predicted turnover was around £15m when the bank took them on as a client, but they ended up depositing over £365m over a five-year period, with the vast majority being in hard cash.
Many individual staff members did pick up on the activity, with one employee who’d been working for decades saying it was the most suspicious activity they’d seen in their career. Ultimately, the court found, the bank did not miss this. The criminality was spotted time and time again, but the systems and adequacy of the scrutiny failed. 
Turkey grey-listed by FATF
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), listed Turkey, alongside Mali and Jordan, on the watchdog’s grey list. This comes on the back of a “large number of serious issues” identified in the countries’ mutual evaluations in 2019. The three countries join a 22-state list subject to special monitoring, including Albania, Morocco, Syria and Yemen. However the FATF removed Botswana and Mauritius from the grey list, citing increased improvements.  
Of particular concern to the FATF are Turkey’s banking and real estate sectors, as well as gold and precious stone dealers. Given Turkey’s proximity to Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, there are significant fears about terrorist financing crossing the relatively porous border and entering a large economy on the edge of Europe. The move could have significant implications for supply chains running through Turkey, who may need to undertake greatly enhanced due diligence for any businesses involved in the Turkish economy.
Enforcement steps up in Dubai
The United Arab Emirates moved a step forward in setting itself up as a financial centre of the Middle East. It launched a special court to combat money laundering and handed out over $12m in AML fines to banks in one month alone. The establishment of a specific court came in the same year as a new Executive Office to tackle AML, showing the country’s commitment to tackling financial crime.
Dubai is also investing heavily in the crypto space, while ensuring AML requirements for those businesses. The Emirates have been working closely with the FATF to ensure the nation’s legal, regulatory and operational standards meet international requirements. With political developments such as normalising relations with tech-hub Israel and reform of its strict Islamic social laws, Dubai could be set to join the international finance ranks of New York, London and Singapore within the very near future. 
Crypto continues to make headlines
The ECB called for global regulation of crypto currencies to reduce the loopholes money launderers can exploit, and according to a variety of regulators, these are many. The UK’s FCA reported that a significant number of crypto asset providers had not met the standards required under British AML rules. Many did not get licences as a result. The EU also proposed new changes to require companies that transfer crypto assets to collect details on recipients and senders. Meanwhile, the US authorities announced the establishment of a new team to tackle complex investigations and prosecute criminal misuse of crypto. 
Despite the regulatory pushback and noted environmental concerns of crypto mining, more and more asset providers are jumping into the space. 2021 saw new currencies launched and the rise of NFTs, digital artworks which can be sold for hundreds of thousands, presenting ever more challenges for AML compliance.

Thorncroft was the former Chair of the Association of UK Payment Institutions who worked with lawmakers and financial regulators providing anti-money laundering advice and training.Thorncroft held himself out as a money laundering expert whose role was to protect members of the public and businesses from economic crime. However, he was a professional enabler to fraudsters, allowing his business to transfer their criminal proceeds abroad.An investigation by the Metropolitan Police, which began in 2016, found evidence that linked Thorncroft to an investment fraud which took place in 2014. This investigation revealed that Thorncroft had allowed his Money Service Bureau business to be used by the fraudsters to transfer money to Hong Kong and China.The CPS and the police were able to prove that Thorncroft should have known or suspected that the money passing through his business’s bank accounts was criminal property. Despite his substantial knowledge and expertise of money laundering, Thorncroft failed to alert the authorities to the suspicious activity and allowed it to continue.Stephane Pendered of the CPS said: “Dominic Thorncroft did not commit the fraud himself. However, his actions have allowed £850,000 defrauded from 60 individuals to be dispersed across the world.“Thorncroft promoted himself as an anti-money laundering expert but failed to live up to the standards he set for others, so when his business was clearly being used to launder criminal property, he failed to follow his own advice and report what was happening to the authorities.”The CPS is committed to continue to work alongside law enforcement to bring prosecutions where professional enablers are seen to assist criminals in this way. The CPS is also committed to working more widely with banks, businesses, charities and beyond, to help educate others so that they can avoid becoming victims of economic crime.This case was prosecuted by the Specialist Fraud Division of the CPS, a dedicated prosecuting team which deals with the most serious, complex, and difficult economic crime cases, including corruption and money-laundering.Detective Sergeant Mark Hoddinott, from the Central Specialist Crime Command (Economic Crime), Metropolitan Police, said: ""This was a really complex fraud investigation where a person with serious responsibilities and knowledge of the regulations around anti-money laundering failed in their duties to make the required disclosures to the authorities.“If Thorncroft had complied with his own company policies then he would not have been prosecuted. Instead, he paid absolutely no regards to his overriding duty to anti-money regulations; consequently, many individuals suffered great financial loss and considerable personal trauma.""In his role as the chairperson of AUKPI, Dominic Thorncroft worked closely with law makers, regulators, banks, and other financial institutions, representing the interests of the money remittance sector. The AUKPI provided its members with anti-money laundering training. Mr Thorncroft has clearly betrayed his AUKPI members and ruined his career.  ""Thornicroft’s failings cost the sixty-plus victims more than three quarters of a million pounds and allowed an overseas fraudster to profit from their misery.""I'm really pleased that a dedicated team of Met officers investigating this case have secured this conviction, especially to Detective Constable Silje Mikkelsen for her investigative tenacity and commitment to supporting the victims. I would also like to express my thanks and gratitude go out to the jury who I am sure at times found the case being presented before them complex and possibly confusing.""Today's conviction is a reminder to those working in the regulated sector of their duties when it comes to money laundering regulations.”Notes to editorsStephane Pendered is a specialist prosecutor for the CPS Specialist Fraud DivisionThe Specialist Fraud Division is a dedicated CPS team playing a leading role in the fight against serious and complex economic crime and the financial exploitation of the public, using specialist legal expertise to deliver justiceThe CPS Economic Crime Strategy 2025 is available on our websiteCPS News CentreFind out what's new at the Crown Prosecution Service's digital News Centre.Browse & searchRelated Prosecution GuidanceMoney Laundering Offences

Tencent also failed to fully comply with rules around checking the identity of merchants and individuals as well as the source of their funds, the newspaper said.Tencent was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC Monday.Shares in the tech firm fell nearly 10% to close at 331.80 Hong Kong dollars ($42.38), their lowest closing level since Dec. 5, 2019.Since a record high close of 766.50 Hong Kong dollars in January 2021, Tencent shares have shed around 56%, wiping off more than $500 billion of value off the company.The WSJ report comes after more than a year of intense regulatory tightening by Beijing on the country's technology sector that has sought to rein in the power and stamp out some of the alleged bad behaviors of the biggest technology companies. China has sought to introduce regulation in areas ranging from anti-trust to data protection.A particular focus of regulators has been non-bank financial players such as Tencent and Alibaba-affiliate Ant Group. These companies offer financial services but traditionally without the strict regulation that banks face. China is looking to change that.Tencent has, so far, managed to escape a major regulatory blow, unlike Alibaba and Meituan which have both been hit with anti-trust fines.The Wall Street Journal said that Tencent's potential fine could be at least hundreds of millions of yuan, but it is still under deliberation.The Hong Kong-listed shares of other Chinese tech names also took a battering on Monday as already-fragile sentiment towards the country's internet sector continues to get tested.China is facing a new wave of Covid infections across the country leading to lockdowns in cities and factories closing. Meanwhile, investors are still on edge about whether U.S.-listed Chinese companies could face delistings and if Beijing's regulatory onslaught will continue.TVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT |   ETListenTVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT |   ETListenSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Only one conviction in last four years under AML law, MPs panel told


By Our Correspondent 

December 02, 2021 










ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has informed the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance that the tax authorities have attached properties worth Rs235 billion, in total 215 registered FIRs, during the last four years under the Anti Money Laundering (AML) law.




The National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance met under chairmanship of Faiz Ullah here at the Parliament House on Wednesday. When the parliamentarians inquired about convictions before a court of law under the AML to satisfy the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the FBR high-ups replied that the first conviction was achieved in a case based in Peshawar related to Inland Revenue (IR).However, there was no conviction on Customs side, said FBR’s Director General Intelligence & Investigation of Inland Revenue Aamir Talpur, while testifying before the NA panel. “To implement the AML Law, we have registered 215 FIRs against 267 accused and attached properties worth Rs235 billion involving a tax amount of Rs76 billion. The FBR also attached 640 bank accounts.The Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) sends us Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) after receiving and analyzing data from 8 to 9 relevant agencies."" The FBR cannot close down an investigation on its own, Aamir Talpur said.The Chairman of NA Panel, Faiz Ullah, raised concerns by Faisalabad's business community on the rampant use of AML laws against them and argued that tax evasion and money laundering should be dealt with separately. PMLN leader Ahsan Iqbal also argued that the laws were bulldozed in haste to pass this AML law to victimize Mian Nawaz Sharif, but now this law was being used to harrass businessmen. The Chairman FBR, Dr. Ashfaque Ahmed, said tax evasion having linkages of criminal proceeds was handed over to the jurisdiction of tax machinery. Despite limited workforce, he said that the FBR had to perform reluctantly in accordance with the mandate given by the Parliament.The FBR’s DG I&I IR, Aamir Talpur, said that Financial Monitoring Unit is the focal point for receiving all data and after analysing it, Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) are prepared, which are forwarded to the relevant law enforcing agencies. In case of tax-related issues of Income Tax or Sales Tax, the STRs were forwarded to FBR’s Inland Revenue and in case of Customs, it is forwarded to FBR’s Customs Intelligence Wing. He cited the example of an 80-year-old person who deposited multimillion rupees cash while declaring taxable income of just Rs0.2 million. He said that the FBR collected evidence and presented it before the court of law following which the properties and banks accounts were attached, he added.The PPP Parliamentarian's Dr. Nafisa Shah asked for furnishing details of Saudi loan deposit and oil facility to the tune of $4.2 billion for one year, in the next meeting at which the Director General Debt Ministry of Finance requested for an in-camera session for sharing details of the Saudi agreement.The Ministry of Finance also presented Federal Government Properties Management Bill 2021 before the committee. The new bill proposed to establish Property Management Authority under a Director General for three years tenure. Following this, a board will also be established and this Authority will have the mandate to develop properties for commercial purposes. It will have the powers to mortgage, rent, or lease out government-owned properties.PPP MNA Dr. Nafisa Shah and PMLN's Ahsan Iqbal strongly opposed the bill, arguing it would open a new Pandora's box. They asked for incorporating the viewpoint of major stakeholders such as railways, defense ministry, ports and shipping and others because neither the ministries nor the departments would be willing to hand over their properties to the proposed authority. The committee deferred its approval for the next meeting.

   U.K. regulators handed down a record level of anti-money laundering penalties to banks in 2021, and experts anticipate fines to remain elevated as the country's Financial Conduct Authority embraces its powers to pursue criminal prosecutions.
Cases led by the Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, against NatWest Group PLC, Credit Suisse AG and HSBC Holdings PLC helped to drive the value of U.K. anti-money laundering fines to $672 million in 2021, more than tripling from $206 million in 2020, according to research by regulatory technology company Fenergo.
""In the past, fines were seen just as the cost of doing business,"" said Nick Baxter, a U.K.-based banking consultant and director at Rockstead, a provider of regulatory compliance services. ""Now you've got to a point where the fines are so great, it's no longer cheaper to pay the fine and not fix the systems and controls.""
Regulators across Europe are issuing larger fines than previously, said Rachel Woolley, global director of financial crime at Fenergo. There has been ""a shift in the narrative"" in that ""eye-watering penalties"" are no longer coming exclusively from U.S. regulators, Woolley said.
The increase in total fines value in Europe, and the U.K. in particular, bucked the global trend in 2021. The value of penalties related to breaches of anti-money laundering, sanctions, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and data privacy regulation worldwide halved last year, with U.S.-issued fines down about 75%, according to the research.

Beware the watchdog
The fact that the FCA is prepared to use its criminal powers has made it ""a more powerful force,"" said Tony Wyatt, associate counsel at Ewing Law.
A case against NatWest in 2021 was the first time the FCA pursued criminal charges against a bank since it was given such powers under 2007 money-laundering regulation. It resulted in a U.K. court issuing a £264.8 million fine to NatWest in December 2021, after the bank pleaded guilty to failing to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited hundreds of millions of pounds in cash over five years. CEO Alison Rose said at the time that NatWest regretted the failure and that it takes its responsibility to prevent and detect financial crime ""extremely seriously.""
The conviction was a ""big win"" for the FCA and will likely give it the confidence to pursue criminal enforcement actions in the future, said Julian Hui, a senior associate in the financial services regulatory practice at law firm Baker McKenzie in London.
""The FCA is demonstrating that it can actually do these big criminal enforcements and get big outcomes. [The NatWest conviction] will probably embolden it a little bit,"" Hui said.
The regulator told the Financial Times it has about 40 active anti-money laundering cases, the paper reported Jan. 17. Of those, 29 are regulatory investigations, two are criminal investigations and three are civil probes, while six are ""dual-track,"" meaning they could result in either criminal or civil action.
Court-issued fines can be much larger than those granted directly by the regulator, Hui said. The reputational concern for banks being found guilty of a criminal offense ""is massive,"" Wyatt said, adding that, once dealing with criminal law, directors in a bank can also become personally liable.
Hui expects the FCA to pursue at least one more criminal prosecution related to anti-money laundering regulation in the coming year or two. The big unknown is whether reported staffing shortages might start to bite, Hui said. The FCA had to turn to private law firms to help process applications and spent almost £1 million on headhunters in 2021 amid a high number of vacancies, the Financial Times reported in December.
When asked about the regulator's appetite to use its power to pursue criminal convictions, an FCA spokesperson said via email that anti-money laundering cases ""remain a strategic priority"" and that it ""will take whatever enforcement action is necessary based on the evidence.""
New European narrative
Europe, the Middle East and Africa was the only region in which the value of financial penalties increased in 2021, jumping to $3.45 billion from just over $1 billion in 2020, according to Fenergo.

Three of the five largest money-laundering penalties in 2021 came from Europe. These include a €1.8 billion fine issued to UBS AG after a French court found it had concealed serious tax fraud and illegal banking activities in the country, and a €480 million settlement between ABN AMRO Bank NV and Dutch prosecutors over anti-money laundering failings. The NatWest fine in the U.K. was the fifth-largest penalty of the year.
The U.S. continued to rank among the top issuers of financial fines, though penalties dropped to $1.20 billion in 2021 from $4.40 billion a year earlier, according to Fenergo. While U.S. regulators in the past have issued material fines to non-U.S. banks, 2021 saw a larger focus on local banks, with penalties generally of a lower value, Woolley said.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Friday, April 1, 2022 
MS-13 Leader Sentenced to Life in Federal Prison for Racketeering Conspiracy and Murder
Defendant Directed and/or Participated in Murders in Maryland and Virginia
A New Jersey man was sentenced to life in prison today for murder in aid of racketeering; conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering; conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, cocaine, and heroin; and possession with intent to distribute heroin.
Miguel Angel Corea Diaz aka Reaper, 41, of Long Branch, a leader in the transnational criminal enterprise La Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13, was convicted by a federal jury on Nov. 23, 2021, after a four-week trial. Co-defendant Junior Noe Alvarado-Requeno aka Insolente and Trankilo, 24, of Landover, Maryland, was also convicted at trial and faces a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. He is scheduled to be sentenced on April 25.
According to court documents, MS-13 is a transnational gang composed primarily of immigrants or descendants from El Salvador. MS-13 has branches or “cliques” that operate throughout Frederick County, Anne Arundel County, Prince George’s County, and Montgomery County, Maryland and elsewhere on the East Coast. 
“The brutality of Corea Diaz is almost unfathomable,” said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to remove these violent gang members to keep our communities safe from the violence perpetrated by MS-13. With the help of members of our communities we will work to bring to justice those MS-13 members who commit these horrible crimes.”
“As members of MS-13, Corea Diaz and his co-conspirators were ruthless and showed no regard for human life by extorting innocent people, tampering with witnesses, and ordering a murder over a drug dispute,” said Assistant Director in Charge Steven M. D’Antuono of the FBI Washington Field Office. “With today’s sentence, Corea Diaz will no longer be able to commit senseless violence and homicidal acts on our streets. The FBI remains steadfast in our resolve to work with our partners to ensure that individuals like Corea Diaz are held accountable for their crimes and to eliminate MS-13's violence from our communities.”
“The ruthlessness of MS-13 in pursuit of profits shows a clear link between violence and the illicit drug trade,” said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. “Today’s sentence won’t undo the harm Diaz is responsible for, but it ensures that for the rest of his life, he will no longer be a direct threat to the communities he terrorized for so long. DEA will continue to work tirelessly with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to ensure violent criminals like Diaz are taken off the streets, helping to make American communities safer and healthier.”
“Any time we can get a notorious gang member off the streets, it is a victory for both law enforcement and law-abiding citizens,” said Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore. “In this case, the criminal is particularly violent, and now he will face the consequences of his crimes.  HSI is grateful to have worked with our partnering federal and local law enforcement agencies to make the communities safer for the citizens of Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia.”
According to evidence presented at trial, between 2015 and 2018, Corea Diaz and his co-defendant Alvarado-Requeno controlled and operated the Sailors Locos Salvatruchos Westside (S.L.S.W. or Sailors) Clique. This Sailors Clique was involved in a host of significant criminal activity including murder, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering, and witness tampering. Evidence showed that the gang ran a “protection” scheme in and around its home base in Langley Park, Maryland, and extorted local businesses by charging them “rent” for the privilege of operating in MS-13 “territory.” The gang also trafficked in illegal drugs, including heroin and cocaine. A large share of the proceeds of the gang’s illegal activities were sent to gang leadership in El Salvador using structured transactions and intermediaries to avoid law enforcement scrutiny.
According to evidence presented at trial, the Sailors Clique committed acts of violence against suspected rival gang members, as well as against its own membership for breaking gang rules. In March 2017, a member of the Sailors Clique who was hiding from law enforcement in the Lynchburg, Virginia, area had a dispute with a local high school student over marijuana. In response, Corea-Diaz and Alvarado-Requeno organized a squad of MS-13 members to drive down to Lynchburg and murder the minor. The gang members kidnapped the student from his front lawn and cut his hand off before killing him. After the murder, Corea Diaz and Alvarado-Requeno helped to hide and protect the killers from law enforcement.
The FBI and HSI investigated the case, with valuable assistance provided by the DEA’s Washington and New York Field Divisions, the Prince George’s County Police Department, the Montgomery County Police Department, the Bedford County Sherriff’s Office, and the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office.
Trial Attorneys Julie Finocchiaro and Alexander Gottfried of the Criminal Division’s Organized Crime and Gang Section and U.S. Attorney Timothy Hagan for the District of Maryland prosecuted the case.

The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) has launched its first criminal prosecution for offences under the Money Laundering Regulations. It is also the first criminal prosecution against a bank for such offences. Previous FCA action has focussed on imposing fines for breaches and regulatory action over criminal prosecution.  However, they have been heavily criticised previously for failing to prosecute breaches. Does this case signal a new regulatory approach?




NatWest Bank is alleged to have accepted cash deposits of £264m without adequately monitoring and scrutinising the suspicious transaction behaviour. Following a four-year long investigation by the FCA, the bank has found itself before the Magistrates’ Court to defend itself against criminal failings to adhere to the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (“MLR”).  However, it is interesting to note that there are no individuals charged with any offences.  The penalties will therefore be financial in nature and will not result in a custodial sentence or criminal conviction for any individual.  The reputational damage, however, is likely to be significant for the bank as the case will be closely monitored as it the first time a bank has faced a criminal prosecution of this nature.

The FCA allege that NatWest failed in its obligation to conduct and demonstrate risk sensitive due diligence and ongoing monitoring of its relationships with its customers for the purposes of preventing money laundering. The issues arise from an account owned by a UK incorporated customer.  It is alleged that around £365 million was paid into the customer’s account, with £264 million paid in cash. NatWest’s handling of those deposits is said to have failed to adhere to the requirements of regulations 8(1), 8(3) and 14(1) of the MLR.

Regulations 8(1) and 8(3) MLR require a relevant person to conduct ongoing monitoring of a business relationship, including keeping up-to-date documents, data or information obtained for the purpose of applying customer due diligence measures. The regulations also provide for the ongoing monitoring of customer due diligence.

Regulation 14(1) MLR relates to enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring.  A relevant person is required to apply enhanced customer due diligence measures and monitoring on a risk-sensitive basis in any situation which presents a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. 
NatWest is to appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 14 April 2021. We will be following the case closely as it progresses.

Does this represent a change in approach by the FCA?  Can we expect to see more criminal prosecutions in the future?   We will have to wait and see if the landscape changes in favour of criminal prosecutions in certain instances.  Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that now is the time to ensure that AML compliance is a priority and that staff training is up to date.

Recent Fines by Regulators

Concerns about AML compliance failures have hit the headlines with increasing frequency in recent months.  We have seen some of the largest fines imposed over recent months by regulators.

Over the last 12 months, we have seen a number of record fines imposed by the FCA and HMRC for non-compliance with money laundering regulations. In June 2020, the FCA issued a £37.8m fine to Commerzbank London for its failures to put in place adequate AML systems and controls between October 2012 and September 2017.  Commerzbank London undertook a significant remediation exercise to bring its AML controls into compliance. The bank also conducted an extensive look-back exercise to identify suspicious transactions during the period in question.

Earlier this year, a money transfer company was handed the largest ever fine issued by HMRC of £23.8m, for ‘significant breaches’ of MLR obligations relating to risk assessments, record-keeping, policies, controls and procedures, and due diligence.

The Gambling Commission has taken similarly stringent action, issuing a fine of £13m to an entertainment business in April 2020. The penalty marked the Gambling Commission’s highest fine to date and was accompanied by strict conditions for the company to maintain its gambling license.  Neil McArthur, Chief Executive of the Gambling Commission described the failings as ‘extremely serious’.  The investigations hinged on failures to conduct enhanced due diligence. The regulator also identified failures by the business to adequately check the sources of funds in several instances.

Against this backdrop, the decision by the FCA to mount a criminal prosecution for the first time indicates a further escalation and a more robust approach towards breaches of money laundering rules.

If my business is under investigation, what should we do?

If you are currently under investigation for AML failings, the latest developments will make for uncomfortable reading.

The MLR compel those conducting regulated activity to take a risk-based and proportionate approach to their compliance obligations. The fundamental statutory obligations mandate regulated businesses to conduct a thorough risk assessment. That risk assessment should be used as the starting point to monitor customer relationships and implement a comprehensive risk and controls framework. Key compliance obligations are to ensure adequate policies and procedures are in place, that they are followed by employees, and that thorough employee training takes place. All controls implemented should be reviewed regularly and updated where appropriate.

Insufficient dedication of properly trained staff to fulfilling ongoing (and time-consuming) compliance requirements is often a feature when breaches occur. It is worth noting that, following its investigation and £37m fine from the FCA, Commerzbank London bolstered its compliance resources from three AML professionals to 50.

We know that the levels of financial crime have increased dramatically during the pandemic and therefore the systems and controls in place to target money laundering are arguably more important than ever. Changes to working practices during the pandemic have meant that many businesses have had to review their AML systems and controls. Conducting operations remotely has affected traditional customer identification and due diligence methods in some businesses. 
Regulated businesses need to review their risk assessments and compliance frameworks regularly as part of their obligations.  However, now is a good time to renew those efforts and ensure that the framework is robust.

Companies would be well advised to take advice at an early stage if potential problems are identified. If you are already under investigation for AML breaches, please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss how we can assist.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File PhotoRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterPRINCETON, N.J., April 2 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve needs to move monetary policy towards a more neutral stance, but the pace at which it tightens credit will depend on how the economy reacts, New York Fed President John Williams said Saturday.Williams, in response to questions at a symposium about whether the Fed needed to hasten its return to a neutral policy rate that neither encourages or discourages spending, noted that in 2019 with rates set near the neutral level ""the economic expansion started to slow,"" and the Fed resorted to rate cuts.""We need to get closer to neutral but we need to watch the whole way,"" Williams said. ""There is no question that is the direction we are moving. Exactly how quickly we do that depends on the circumstances.”Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterWilliams' remarks suggest a more cautious approach to coming rate increases than has been pushed by colleagues who feel the Fed should race towards a more neutral stance by using larger than usual half-point rate hikes at upcoming meetings.The median policymaker estimate of the neutral rate is 2.4%, a level that traders currently feel the central bank will hit by the end of this year. Such a pace would require half point increases at 2 of the Fed's remaining six meetings this year, with expectations of a first coming at the Fed's May 3-4 session.The Fed raised interest rates last month by a quarter of a percentage point, the beginning of what policymakers expect to be ""ongoing increases"" aimed to tame inflation currently running at triple the Fed's 2% target.At the last Fed meeting the median policymaker projected quarter-point increases only at each meeting, but several since then have said they were prepared to move more aggressively if needed.The outcome depends on whether inflation eases, Williams said.""We expect inflation to come down but if it does not….we will have to respond. My hope right now is that won't happen,” Williams said.The Fed will also be using a second tool to tighten credit when it starts to reduce the size of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Williams said that could begin as soon as May.In prepared remarks to a Princeton University symposium Williams said high inflation was currently the Fed's ""greatest challenge,"" and is potentially being driven higher by the war in Ukraine, the ongoing pandemic, and continued labor and supply shortages in the United States.""Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains extraordinarily high, and risks to the inflation outlook are particularly acute,"" Williams said.However, he said he expected the combination of rate increases and balance sheet reduction to help ease inflation to around 4% this year, and ""close to our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2024"" while keeping the economy on track.""These actions should enable us to manage the proverbial soft landing in a way that maintains a sustained strong economy and labor market,"" Williams said.
