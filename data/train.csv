Thorncroft was the former Chair of the Association of UK Payment Institutions who worked with lawmakers and financial regulators providing anti-money laundering advice and training.Thorncroft held himself out as a money laundering expert whose role was to protect members of the public and businesses from economic crime. However, he was a professional enabler to fraudsters, allowing his business to transfer their criminal proceeds abroad.An investigation by the Metropolitan Police, which began in 2016, found evidence that linked Thorncroft to an investment fraud which took place in 2014. This investigation revealed that Thorncroft had allowed his Money Service Bureau business to be used by the fraudsters to transfer money to Hong Kong and China.The CPS and the police were able to prove that Thorncroft should have known or suspected that the money passing through his business’s bank accounts was criminal property. Despite his substantial knowledge and expertise of money laundering, Thorncroft failed to alert the authorities to the suspicious activity and allowed it to continue.Stephane Pendered of the CPS said: “Dominic Thorncroft did not commit the fraud himself. However, his actions have allowed £850,000 defrauded from 60 individuals to be dispersed across the world.“Thorncroft promoted himself as an anti-money laundering expert but failed to live up to the standards he set for others, so when his business was clearly being used to launder criminal property, he failed to follow his own advice and report what was happening to the authorities.”The CPS is committed to continue to work alongside law enforcement to bring prosecutions where professional enablers are seen to assist criminals in this way. The CPS is also committed to working more widely with banks, businesses, charities and beyond, to help educate others so that they can avoid becoming victims of economic crime.This case was prosecuted by the Specialist Fraud Division of the CPS, a dedicated prosecuting team which deals with the most serious, complex, and difficult economic crime cases, including corruption and money-laundering.Detective Sergeant Mark Hoddinott, from the Central Specialist Crime Command (Economic Crime), Metropolitan Police, said: ""This was a really complex fraud investigation where a person with serious responsibilities and knowledge of the regulations around anti-money laundering failed in their duties to make the required disclosures to the authorities.“If Thorncroft had complied with his own company policies then he would not have been prosecuted. Instead, he paid absolutely no regards to his overriding duty to anti-money regulations; consequently, many individuals suffered great financial loss and considerable personal trauma.""In his role as the chairperson of AUKPI, Dominic Thorncroft worked closely with law makers, regulators, banks, and other financial institutions, representing the interests of the money remittance sector. The AUKPI provided its members with anti-money laundering training. Mr Thorncroft has clearly betrayed his AUKPI members and ruined his career.  ""Thornicroft’s failings cost the sixty-plus victims more than three quarters of a million pounds and allowed an overseas fraudster to profit from their misery.""I'm really pleased that a dedicated team of Met officers investigating this case have secured this conviction, especially to Detective Constable Silje Mikkelsen for her investigative tenacity and commitment to supporting the victims. I would also like to express my thanks and gratitude go out to the jury who I am sure at times found the case being presented before them complex and possibly confusing.""Today's conviction is a reminder to those working in the regulated sector of their duties when it comes to money laundering regulations.”Notes to editorsStephane Pendered is a specialist prosecutor for the CPS Specialist Fraud DivisionThe Specialist Fraud Division is a dedicated CPS team playing a leading role in the fight against serious and complex economic crime and the financial exploitation of the public, using specialist legal expertise to deliver justiceThe CPS Economic Crime Strategy 2025 is available on our websiteCPS News CentreFind out what's new at the Crown Prosecution Service's digital News Centre.Browse & searchRelated Prosecution GuidanceMoney Laundering Offences

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File PhotoRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterPRINCETON, N.J., April 2 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve needs to move monetary policy towards a more neutral stance, but the pace at which it tightens credit will depend on how the economy reacts, New York Fed President John Williams said Saturday.Williams, in response to questions at a symposium about whether the Fed needed to hasten its return to a neutral policy rate that neither encourages or discourages spending, noted that in 2019 with rates set near the neutral level ""the economic expansion started to slow,"" and the Fed resorted to rate cuts.""We need to get closer to neutral but we need to watch the whole way,"" Williams said. ""There is no question that is the direction we are moving. Exactly how quickly we do that depends on the circumstances.”Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterWilliams' remarks suggest a more cautious approach to coming rate increases than has been pushed by colleagues who feel the Fed should race towards a more neutral stance by using larger than usual half-point rate hikes at upcoming meetings.The median policymaker estimate of the neutral rate is 2.4%, a level that traders currently feel the central bank will hit by the end of this year. Such a pace would require half point increases at 2 of the Fed's remaining six meetings this year, with expectations of a first coming at the Fed's May 3-4 session.The Fed raised interest rates last month by a quarter of a percentage point, the beginning of what policymakers expect to be ""ongoing increases"" aimed to tame inflation currently running at triple the Fed's 2% target.At the last Fed meeting the median policymaker projected quarter-point increases only at each meeting, but several since then have said they were prepared to move more aggressively if needed.The outcome depends on whether inflation eases, Williams said.""We expect inflation to come down but if it does not….we will have to respond. My hope right now is that won't happen,” Williams said.The Fed will also be using a second tool to tighten credit when it starts to reduce the size of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Williams said that could begin as soon as May.In prepared remarks to a Princeton University symposium Williams said high inflation was currently the Fed's ""greatest challenge,"" and is potentially being driven higher by the war in Ukraine, the ongoing pandemic, and continued labor and supply shortages in the United States.""Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains extraordinarily high, and risks to the inflation outlook are particularly acute,"" Williams said.However, he said he expected the combination of rate increases and balance sheet reduction to help ease inflation to around 4% this year, and ""close to our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2024"" while keeping the economy on track.""These actions should enable us to manage the proverbial soft landing in a way that maintains a sustained strong economy and labor market,"" Williams said.

Opinion: Why gold and platinum are a window into the stock market’s future and what investors can expect

COMP

 
                    +0.29%



























The stock market’s prospects for the next 12 months are only modestly positive. That’s the conclusion of a market-timing model based on the ratio of gold’s price 
        GC00,
        +0.25%
       to platinum’s 
        PL00,
        +0.15%.
       You might think it’s good news that equities’ 12-month potential is as promising now as it was in early 2021. But, in fact, most stocks have struggled since then. A relatively small number of large-cap stocks have propelled the S&P 500 
        SPX,
        +0.34%
       higher, and the Russell 2000 index 
        RUT,
        +1.01%
       is 9.2% lower than where it stood when my early-2021 column on this gold-platinum ratio was published. The Nasdaq Composite Index 
        COMP,
        +0.29%
       is just 1.8% higher while the Russell Micro-Cap Index  is 14.7% lower. (Data, courtesy of FactSet, are through Mar. 28.)

The discovery of the gold-platinum ratio’s market-timing potential traces to a 2019 study in the Journal of Financial Economics. It showed that a rising gold-platinum ratio forecasts higher stock market returns over the subsequent 12 months, and vice versa. Entitled “Gold, Platinum and Expected Stock Returns,” its authors are Darien Huang, a former finance professor at Cornell University, and Mete Kilic, a finance professor at the University of Southern California. The chart below plots this gold-platinum ratio over the last 20 years. Notice that the ratio declined for many years prior to and including the 2008 financial crisis, correctly predicting less upside potential for the stock market. Since 2008, in contrast, the ratio has for the most part steadily risen — as has the stock market.









During the COVID pandemic of the past two years the ratio has been highly volatile: It spiked in the wake of the market’s waterfall decline in March 2020, anticipating the market’s huge potential over the subsequent 12 months. Since then it fell, rose again, and over the past couple of months has fallen back. The ratio works, according to the professors, because platinum and gold respond to different factors. While platinum primarily reflects changes in industrial demand, gold responds both to that demand as well as investors’ desire to hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainty. By focusing on the ratio of gold’s price to platinum’s, you zero in on that portion of gold’s price that is a hedge against uncertainty. Since the stock market’s expected return is compensation for uncertainty and risk, this ratio should be particularly valuable to market timers. That’s exactly what the professors found. Since 1975, the gold-platinum ratio has had a significantly better track record predicting the market’s subsequent 12-month return than nine other well-known indicators that other researchers previously found to have predictive ability — including, prominently, the Cyclically-Adjusted PE Ratio, or CAPE, made famous by Yale University (and Nobel laureate) Robert Shiller.The ‘war puzzle‘ You might find it surprising that the gold-platinum ratio has fallen in recent months, which suggests that risk has declined. Yet in February Russia invaded Ukraine and, according to some, the conflict could lead to World War III. That certainly seems like the very definition of heightened risk. In fact, however, the gold-platinum ratio’s decline in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is not that unexpected. In academic circles it’s been known for some time that the stock market tends to experience below-average volatility during wars and military conflicts — a pattern known as the “war puzzle.” According to a study that the National Bureau of Economic Research began circulating a couple of weeks ago, stock market volatility has been “33 percent lower during major wars and periods of conflict since 1921.” The study, “Stock Volatility and the War Puzzle,” was conducted by Gustavo Cortes, a finance professor at the University of Florida; Angela Vossmeyer, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College, and Marc Weidenmier, a research associate at Chapman College. They at least partially solved the puzzle, finding that increased defense spending during wars and military conflicts leads corporate profits to become more predictable. That in turn translates to lower stock market volatility and risk. Regardless of whether this solves the “war puzzle,” the message of the gold-platinum based indicator with a good market-timing record is that the stock market’s potential over the next 12 months is only moderately positive.

Danske Bank Secures a Big Victory in Investor Suit Based on Alleged AML Violations


By Izabella Babchinetskaya on September 9, 2021
Posted in Civil Liability to Private Parties, Investor Suits




Copenhagen, Denmark
Danske Bank (Danske) recently secured a big victory in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  On August 25, 2021, the appellate court unanimously affirmed the Southern District of New York’s dismissal of an investor lawsuit brought by purchasers of DB American Depository Receipts (ADR) against Danske and its former officers and board members over alleged misrepresentations about Danske’s financial condition.  We previously blogged about the lower court’s decision here.  As we have blogged about here, here, here, and here, Danske Bank has been the subject of significant regulatory oversight due to its alleged AML failures of historical proportions, which has resulted in a foreseeable onslaught of investor lawsuits.
Although much of the Second Circuit’s opinion is focused on timing issues relevant to almost any investor lawsuit based on material misstatements and omissions, portions of the opinion are particularly relevant to investor claims resting on alleged AML failures and money laundering by financial institution customers.  Importantly, neither knowledge of potential misconduct by customers gained by an institution from either its AML-related monitoring or whistleblower reporting, nor generalized claims to investors by an institution of robust AML compliance, will – standing alone – result in liability.
As a recap, the class action sought relief for Danske’s alleged failure to follow AML protocols in regards to its Estonian Branch—a scandal that first surfaced in 2016, eventually shedding light on approximately $230 billion in alleged suspicious transactions.  The lawsuit alleged that Danske failed to supervise the Estonian Branch, responded poorly to AML issues, and made several misstatements and omissions.  Among several claims, the plaintiffs brought suit under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, as enforced by Rule 10b-5.  The appeal focused on the first element required under the provision—the existence of a material misrepresentation, misstatement, or omission.
The plaintiffs alleged five categories of misstatements and omissions.  In affirming the lower court’s decision, the appellate court held that none of the alleged misstatements or omissions were actionable—“the allegations [did] not move the claims outside of the realm of corporate mismanagement and into the realm of securities fraud.”  The five at-issue categories and the court’s reasoning as to why they were not actionable are listed below.

Financial Statements. The plaintiffs argued that Danske’s 2013 to 2015 financial statements included revenue from the illegal transactions without a disclosure of possible money laundering activity.  The court, however, emphasized that financial disclosures are not automatically misleading “by virtue of the company’s nondisclosure of suspected misconduct that may have contributed to the financial results.” The court stressed that an alleged failure to disclose in financial statements “uncharged, unadjudicated wrongdoing” generally cannot form the basis for a viable misstatement theory.  This finding is potentially quite helpful and important for financial institutions in regards to investor lawsuits based on alleged AML violations – because, almost invariably, a financial institution’s AML compliance program will identify, and therefore put the institution “on notice,” of potential misconduct (and uncharged) by customers.  Indeed, that is one of the main goals – if not the main goal – of maintaining an AML compliance program.

The court also rejected a related argument that Danske’s financial reports were per se misleading because of alleged noncompliance with standards promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board – specifically, because Danske purportedly “violated those standards by including revenue derived from unenforceable [deposit] contracts” with clients using the Estonian branch to launder money.  However, whether the contracts were actually unenforceable turned on foreign contract law, and the plaintiffs failed to identify any law or contract provision rendering the contracts unenforceable.

Goodwill Impairment. The plaintiffs claimed that it was misleading for Danske in 2014 to characterize its goodwill impairment write-down as a “technical” accounting matter when the impairment was really a consequence of Danske’s decision to eliminate its Non-Resident Portfolio (NRP) that was the source of the suspicious activity.  The court disagreed, stating that “materiality can have a half-life.”  Because of the passage of time between the statement and the purchase of shares and the scrutiny Danske faced for its AML noncompliance, the goodwill statements “were too remote in time to have ‘assumed actual significance.’”
Whistleblower Comment. Danske’s 2015 statement regarding a new whistleblower reporting system was purportedly materially misleading by omission, because “Danske misled investors by touting its new anonymous whistleblower system while failing to simultaneously discuss the issues raised” by the whistleblower who had emailed Danske executives directly about his concerns regarding money laundering in the Estonian branch.  Significantly, like the goodwill statements, the whistleblower comment was made three years before the plaintiffs purchased any ADRs, which significantly diminished this statement’s impact on investors in 2018.  This timing issue doomed the claim, even if Danske’s statement and alleged omission was assumed to be misleading.
Corporate Responsibility Statements. The plaintiffs claimed that corporate governance statements related to Danske’s AML compliance were misleading.  The court held that the general statements about the importance of acting lawfully and with integrity were mere puffery, not actionable, and not likely to have impacted investors three years after the AML scandal surfaced. More specifically, statements by Danske that it complied with internationally-recognized Know Your Customer procedures and customer due diligence standards were insufficiently detailed and specific to support a claim.  Likewise, “[a]lthough Danske averred that it took steps to comply with AML protocols and vaguely recited some AML buzzwords, it claims no particular acts of compliance.”  Therefore, no reasonable investor – particularly one who purchased the ADRs years after the “gigantic” AML scandal at Danske had surfaced – would rely on such statements when investing.
2018 Contingencies Footnote. Finally, plaintiffs asserted that Danske’s statement that it did not expect the scandal to materially impact its financial position was misleading because Danske knew that the scope of the scandal exceeded what had been reported.  The plaintiffs, however, purchased the ADRs about three weeks before this statement was made; therefore, the statement could not have influenced the price of a purchase that plaintiffs already made.

All in all, this decision is a positive result for financial institutions, as it provides several key takeaways for what a court considers to be actionable misrepresentations and omissions in the context of alleged AML violations – even in the specific context of the greatest AML scandal to date, at least in regards to sheer volume and monetary value of the alleged suspicious transactions.

Anti-money laundering expert convicted for failure to report money laundering


The former chairman of the Association of UK Payment Institutions, which represents payment institutions regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, has been convicted in relation to an £850,000 investment fraud.Dominic Thorncroft was found guilty of failing to alert the authorities to money laundering, retaining wrongful credit (a theft offence) and breaching money laundering regulations.Thorncroft was a self-described money laundering expert whose job was to protect individuals and businesses from economic crime. He also allowed his business accounts to be used by fraudsters to transfer money to Hong Kong and China.Stephane Pendered of the Crown Prosecution Service said, “Thorncroft promoted himself as an anti-money laundering expert but failed to live up to the standards he set for others, so when his business was clearly being used to launder criminal property, he failed to follow his own advice and report what was happening to the authorities.”Crucially, Thorncroft did not commit fraud himself. However, it can be a criminal offence to allow money laundering and to fail to report suspicions or knowledge of money laundering to the authorities.Your business may also be subject to money laundering regulations, and if so, staying on the right side of the law should be a major concern for you.Here, we outline when someone may be penalised for failing to comply with requirements to detect, report and prevent money laundering.What is Money laundering?Money laundering is defined under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (PoCA) as a range of offences “concerning the possession, concealment, conversion, transfer or making of arrangements relating to the proceeds of crime. This is not limited to money or cash”.It is the “process by which the proceeds of crime are converted into assets which appear to have a legitimate origin”.There are two types of money laundering offences:Those who commit money laundering offences and launder the proceeds of crime.Those who only launder the proceeds of crime committed by others.We are concerned with the second type of money laundering offences.The laws behind anti-money launderingAnti-money laundering in the UK is comprised of various laws and regulations, including:The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (PoCA) – the primary law covering money laundering.The Terrorism Act 2000 (TACT) – which focuses on terrorism financing.The Money Laundering Regulations – place anti-money laundering obligations on certain higher-risk private sector industries.Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA) – intended to smooth the Brexit transition in relation to international anti-money laundering standards.What types of business have anti-money laundering duties?Businesses in certain sectors – including accountants, estate agents and financial service businesses – are required to comply with the money laundering regulations and must be monitored by the relevant supervisory authority.Some businesses are regulated by an industry specific body, such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).If a business is not already supervised but it falls into one of seven categories, it must register with HMRC to be able to carry out the typical kinds of activities associated with their type of business. These seven business types are:Money service businesses not supervised by the FCAHigh value dealersTrust or company service providers not supervised by the FCA or professional bodyEstate agentsBill payment services not supervised by the FCATelecommunications, digital and IT payment service providers not supervised by the FCAArt market participantsLetting agenciesIf a business trades without registering, it is a criminal offence.Under the Money Laundering Regulations, supervisory bodies can investigate and impose penalties for breaches.Where a breach of regulations is serious, the body will usually refer the case to criminal enforcement authorities such as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).Failure to comply with the Regulations may lead to criminal offences under PoCA and TACT.What are businesses’ anti-money laundering obligations?Businesses affected by Money Laundering Regulations have responsibilities in their day-to-day course of business to carry out ‘customer due diligence’. This essentially means that customers are who they say they are and that their transactions are legitimate.Such obligations include appointing a ‘nominated officer’, providing sufficient training to employees and record keeping.Money laundering criminal offencesRegulation 45 of the Money Laundering RegulationsRegulation 45 creates the offence for failing to comply with money laundering regulations. It is an ‘either-way offence’, which means it can be tried in either the Magistrates’ Court or Crown Court. Conviction can result in a maximum prison sentence on indictment (conviction in the Crown Court) of up to two years and a fine.It is a defence if the accused took all reasonable steps and exercised sufficient due diligence.Regulation 47 provides that a corporate body (such as a limited company) can also commit an offence under Regulation 45 with the consent, connivance or neglect of one of its officers, in which case both the individual and corporate body can be prosecuted.Failure to disclose – Section 330 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002Under section 330 of PoCA, it is a criminal offence for a business in a regulated sector to fail to disclose knowledge or suspicions of money laundering to a ‘nominated officer’.The offence is committed where a person:Receives information in the course of business.Knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in money laundering.Can identify that person or where the laundered money is (or can assist in identification or finding the whereabouts).Fails to disclose to a ‘nominated officer’.Failure to disclose is an ‘either-way’ offence with a maximum penalty on indictment (conviction in the Crown Court) of up to five years imprisonment and a fine.Get specialist advice about money laundering investigations and prosecutions in BournemouthIf you are being faced with investigation or prosecution for a money laundering offence, you need advice from a lawyer who specialises in this area.We are a dedicated criminal defence firm in Bournemouth, Dorset and one of the leading teams of criminal lawyers in the region.

Austrac launches civil proceedings over alleged AML failings at Crown

1st March 2022
 | By Robert Fletcher
			

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac), a government-operated national financial intelligence agency, has commenced civil penalty proceedings against Crown Resorts over allegations of “serious and systemic” anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) failings.

Legal action follows compliance work with the casino sector, which Austrac said led to a number of detailed enforcement investigations including into compliance of the Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth properties.
Austrac’s allegations include that the two properties failed to appropriately assess the money laundering and terrorism financing risks they faced, including the likelihood and impact of those risks, and to identify and respond to changes in risk over time.
Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth were also found to have not included in their AML/CTF programs appropriate risk-based systems and controls to mitigate and manage the risks to Crown.
Austrac also said the properties did not establish an appropriate framework for board and senior management oversight of the AML/CTF programs, nor did they have a transaction monitoring program to help identify suspicious activity that was risk-based or appropriate to the nature, size and complexity of Crown.
Other alleged failings included that the properties did not have an appropriate enhanced customer due diligence program to carry out additional checks on higher risk customers, nor did they conduct appropriate ongoing customer due diligence on a players who presented higher money laundering risks.
“Austrac’s investigation identified poor governance, risk management and failures to have and maintain a compliant AML/CTF program detailing how Crown would identify, mitigate and manage the risk of their products and services being misused for money laundering or terrorism financing,” Austrac chief executive Nicole Rose said.
“They also failed to carry out appropriate ongoing customer due diligence including on some very high-risk customers. This led to widespread and serious non-compliance over a number of years..
“Austrac has taken this strong action to achieve enduring change and ensure that Crown will fully meet their obligations to protect themselves and Australia’s financial system from criminal activity.”
Rose also said the absence of appropriate controls and processes meant Crown was unable to appropriately manage high risk customers, which in turn allowed the movement of money in non-transparent ways, making Crown vulnerable to criminal exploitation.
“This is an important reminder to all casinos in Australia that they must have a strong anti-money laundering program in place to protect their business and the community from serious and organised crime,” Rose said.
Austrac said it would not provide further comment on the action or details provided in the court documents now the matter is before the court, adding that whether a civil penalty order is made, and what this could amount, are matters for the court.
Responding to the case, Crown said it had developed a comprehensive remediation plan intended to position the group as a “leader” in the industry in its approach to governance, compliance, responsible gaming and the management of financial crime risk.
These actions included establishing a comprehensive Financial Crime & Compliance Change Program and implementing new controls to manage the risk of financial crime, including a revised Joint AML/CTF program.
Other activity included introducing improved controls to prevent and detect money laundering through Crown’s bank accounts and reduced limits for cash deposits at its casinos, as well as increasing its Financial Crime and Compliance resourcing and capability.
Crown also noted it had invested in automation, specifically a new automated transaction monitoring system and digitised tool to allow electronic submission and investigation of unusual activity reports, while a forensic audit and controls assessment of Crown’s patron bank accounts was carried out by an independent consultant.
“The plan is underpinned by an uplifted organisational culture,” Crown said. “Crown recognises the importance of complying with its financial crime obligations and has overhauled its approach to managing financial crime risk.”
Rose acknowledged these efforts, saying: “Crown is taking steps towards improving its systems, processes and resourcing however there is further work to do and Austrac will continue to work closely with Crown to address ongoing compliance concerns.”
Crown has faced a number of regulatory issues in recent times. In October last year, Crown was found to be “unsuitable” to operate Crown Melbourne in in Victoria following an investigation by the state’s Royal Commission. 
Crown did not lose its licence, due to the potential economic repercussions for Victoria, but was ordered to adhere to special measures, including 33 recommendations made by the Commission.
This investigation came as a result of the Bergin Inquiry in New South Wales, which was launched in August 2019. 
The inquiry assessed Crown’s eligibility to receive a casino licence in Sydney, ultimately deeming it “unsuitable”. However, it said it may still be permitted to operate the casino following implementation of its reforms.
Meanwhile, Austrac said that enforcement investigations into SkyCity Adelaide and the Star Entertainment, announced in June of last year, continue. Star and SkyCity, along with Crown, received notice of the allegations, while the National Bank of Australia (NAB) was also contacted by Austrac.
At the time, Austrac said the matter was related to “serious non-compliance” with the Australian Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Rules Instrument 2007 (AML/CTF Rules).

REUTERS/Arnd WIegmannRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterZURICH, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse faced charges in a Swiss court on Monday of allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros, some of it stuffed into suitcases.In the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland, Swiss prosecutors are seeking around 42.4 million Swiss francs ($45.86 million) in compensation from Credit Suisse (CSGN.S).They say the country's second-biggest bank and one of its former relationship managers did not take all necessary steps to prevent the alleged drug traffickers from hiding and laundering cash between 2004 and 2008.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegister""Credit Suisse unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it and is convinced that its former employee is innocent,"" the bank said in a statement to Reuters. It added it would ""defend itself vigorously in court"".The case has attracted intense interest in Switzerland, where it is seen as a test for prosecutors taking a potentially tougher stance against the country's banks.The indictment runs to more than 500 pages, and centres on relationships that Credit Suisse and its ex-employee had with former Bulgarian wrestler Evelin Banev and multiple associates, two of whom are charged in the case. A second indictment in the case charges a former relationship manager at Julius Baer with facilitating money laundering.A legal representative for the ex-Credit Suisse employee, who cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, said the case was unjustified and his client denied wrongdoing.That banker would start testifying on Wednesday or Thursday, a preliminary court schedule showed.A lawyer for the two alleged gang members, who face charges of multiple counts of misappropriation, fraud and forgery of documents in the Swiss federal court but cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, declined to comment. A lawyer for the former relationship manager at Julius Baer did not respond to requests for comment.Banev, who does not face charges in Switzerland, was convicted of drug trafficking in Italy in 2017 and then in Bulgaria in 2018 for money laundering.He vanished, but was arrested in September in Ukraine.Bulgarian prosecutors are seeking his extradition to face charges of setting up an organised criminal group for money laundering, while Romania seeks him for setting up a group for drug trafficking, Interpol's red list of wanted persons shows.Banev's legal representative had no immediate comment.Julius Baer (BAER.S), which is not facing charges, declined to comment on the case.CASH IN CASESThe former Credit Suisse employee brought at least one Bulgarian customer, who was an associate of Banev, with her when she joined Credit Suisse in 2004, prosecutors allege in the indictment.The customer, who was later shot dead as he left a restaurant with his wife in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2005, had begun placing suitcases full of cash in a safe deposit box at Credit Suisse, the indictment says.Prosecutors allege the gang used a practice known as smurfing, whereby a large sum of money is broken down into smaller amounts that are below the anti-money laundering alert threshold, to launder money, putting millions of euros in small-value bills into safety deposit boxes and later transferring them into accounts.The defendants said this was standard practice at the time the deposits were made, although Swiss private banks have since adopted much tougher anti-money laundering know-your-client checks after international pressure.The prosecutors allege the former relationship manager, who left Credit Suisse in 2010 after being detained for two weeks by police in 2009, helped conceal the criminal origins of money for the clients by carrying out more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions, including 43 million francs in cash.""Our client is being unfairly accused, because Swiss law requires that a person be implicated in order to condemn a bank,"" attorneys at law firm MANGEAT LLC, representing the ex-employee, told Reuters. ""She is innocent, outraged by the accusations. We will plead for her full and complete acquittal.""Credit Suisse disputes the illegal origin of the money, a source familiar with its thinking told Reuters, saying that Banev and his circle operated legitimate businesses in construction, leasing and hotels.The Swiss bank, which the indictment says considered Bulgaria as a high-risk country at the time, plans to draw attention to calls made by its compliance department to Swiss prosecutors after Banev was temporarily arrested in Bulgaria in April 2007, the source added.Credit Suisse is hoping that the court will view that its compliance department's move was a sign of the bank taking its anti-money laundering obligations seriously and of cooperating with prosecutors in the matter.In June 2007, the prosecutors asked Credit Suisse for information on accounts held by Banev and his associates in response to a request from Bulgaria, the source added.Noticing a series of withdrawals, the bank's compliance department asked prosecutors whether to freeze the accounts, but was told not to in order to avoid tipping the clients off, according to the source.By the time prosecutors gave Credit Suisse the go-ahead, much of the money had been withdrawn.The prosecutors' office declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was in the hands of the court.The second indictment filed by federal prosecutors against the former relationship manager at Julius Baer, which is being tried in the same court case, alleges some of the funds were transferred to another Swiss bank.The former relationship manager, who left a few months after the transfers took place, is charged with facilitating money laundering.Julius Baer had refused to accept a suitcase filled with cash from the defendants, the indictment says.($1 = 0.9245 Swiss francs)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterReporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Silke Koltrowitz; Additional reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova; Editing by Alexander Smith and Barbara LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Global InvestorSign up to our investor newsletter to get the latest news and trends in global financial markets.Sign upDaily BriefingSubscribe to our newsletter to get all the news you need to start your day.Sign upSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout ReutersCareersReuters News AgencyBrand Attribution GuidelinesReuters LeadershipReuters Fact CheckReuters Diversity ReportStay InformedDownload the AppNewslettersInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

		NARCL chairman Pradip Shah

Price discovery in the times of NARCL


















	Pradip Shah, who had taken charge as the chairman of National Asset Reconstruction Co Ltd (NARCL), stepped down before the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could approve the proposal, State Bank of India (SBI) said.

	Shah, a financial sector veteran, took charge of the NARCL soon after the debt recast firm received the licence from the RBI.

	According to sources familiar to the development, NARCL sought the RBI’s approval for appointing four directors. The application also indicated Shah's role as the chairman of the board.

	“Directors’ appointment is one among the many appro­vals that an ARC requires prior to commencing business,” SBI said in a statement.

	NARCL has been set up by banks to aggregate and consolidate stressed assets for their subsequent resolution. SBI, along with other public sector banks will have 51 per cent stake in NARCL, the government had said.

	“While these requests were under process, Mr Pradip Shah stepped down from the NARCL Board. The RBI approval, therefore, was received only for the remaining directors. The factual position is that Mr Pradip Shah happened to step down prior to receipt of the RBI approval,” the statement said.

	Sources said the RBI approval for the four candidates were sought on January 21, 2022. Shah stepped down from the post on January 28.

	“RBI wanted some more time, some more background check was required,” said a source, requesting anonymity.

	“The standard process for onboarding of directors for an ARC is to seek prior approval of the RBI. In view of the urgency to operationalise NARCL quickly, soon after receipt of RBI licence, a few directors, including Mr Pradip Shah, were onboarded and an application was submitted to RBI for approval,” the SBI said.

	After Shah stepped down, Subrata Biswas, a deputy managing director of SBI and one of the nominee directors of NARCL, was appointed as interim chairman.

	Sources said that NARCL will seek fresh approval from RBI for appointing the chairman. One director’s post in the NARCL board is still vacant.

In this articleCSG.N-CHA sign above the entrance to the Credit Suisse Group AG headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, on Monday, Nov. 1, 2021.Thi My Lien Nguyen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCredit Suisse will face charges in a Swiss court on Monday of allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros, some of it stuffed into suitcases.Swiss prosecutors say the country's second-biggest bank and one of its former relationship managers did not take all necessary steps to prevent the alleged drug traffickers from hiding and laundering cash between 2004 and 2008.""Credit Suisse unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it and is convinced that its former employee is innocent,"" the bank said in a statement to Reuters.In the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland, prosecutors are seeking around 42.4 million Swiss francs in compensation from Credit Suisse, which added that it would ""defend itself vigorously in court"".The case has attracted intense interest in Switzerland, where it is seen as a test for a potentially tougher stance by prosecutors against the country's banks. The indictment runs to more than 500 pages, and centers on relationships that Credit Suisse and its ex-employee had with former Bulgarian wrestler Evelin Banev and multiple associates, two of whom are charged in the case. A second indictment in the case charges a former relationship manager at Julius Baer with facilitating money laundering.A legal representative for the ex-Credit Suisse employee, who cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, said the case was unjustified and his client denied wrongdoing.A lawyer for the two alleged gang members, who face charges of multiple counts of misappropriation, fraud and forgery of documents in the Swiss federal court but cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, declined to comment. A lawyer for the former relationship manager at Julius Baer did not respond to requests for comment. VIDEO10:3210:32What's happened to Swiss banks?CNBC ExplainsBanev, who does not face charges in Switzerland, was convicted of drug trafficking in Italy in 2017 and then in Bulgaria in 2018 for being part of a criminal organization active in trafficking tones of cocaine from Latin America. He vanished, but was arrested in September in Ukraine, from where Bulgarian prosecutors are seeking his extradition to face charges of setting up an organized criminal group and drug trafficking, Interpol's red list of wanted persons shows.Banev and his legal representatives could not be reached for comment. A lawyer who represented Banev in his Bulgarian trial said she was no longer representing him. Julius Baer, which is not facing charges, declined to comment on the case.   Cash in casesThe former Credit Suisse employee brought at least one Bulgarian customer who was an associate of Banev with her when she joined Credit Suisse in 2004, prosecutors allege in the indictment.VIDEO4:3504:35Credit Suisse 'a great franchise' despite legacy issues, strategist saysSquawk Box EuropeThe customer, who was later shot dead as he left a restaurant with his wife in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2005, had begun placing suitcases full of cash in a safe deposit box at Credit Suisse, the indictment says. Prosecutors allege the gang used so-called smurfing, where a large sum of money is broken down into smaller amounts which are below the anti-money laundering alert threshold, to launder money, putting millions of euros in small-value bills into safety deposit boxes and later transferring them into accounts. Although Swiss private banks have since adopted much tougher anti-money laundering so-called know-your-client checks after international pressure, the defendants said this was standard practice at the time the deposits were made.The prosecutors allege the former relationship manager, who left Credit Suisse in 2010 after being detained for two weeks by police in 2009, helped conceal the criminal origins of money for the clients by carrying out more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions, including 43 million francs in cash. ""Our client is being unfairly accused, because Swiss law requires that a person be implicated in order to condemn a bank,"" attorneys at law firm MANGEAT LLC, representing the ex-employee, told Reuters. ""She is innocent, outraged by the accusations. We will plead for her full and complete acquittal.""VIDEO4:3004:30Accident like Archegos must not happen again, Credit Suisse CEO saysSquawk Box EuropeCredit Suisse disputes the illegal origin of the money, a source familiar with its thinking told Reuters, saying that Banev and his circle operated legitimate businesses in construction, leasing and hotels.The Swiss bank, which the indictment says considered Bulgaria as a high-risk country at the time, plans to draw attention to calls made by its compliance department to Swiss prosecutors after Banev was temporarily arrested in Bulgaria in April 2007, the source added.Credit Suisse is hoping that the court will view that its compliance department's move was a sign of the bank taking its anti-money laundering obligations seriously and of cooperating with prosecutors in the matter.In June 2007, the prosecutors asked Credit Suisse for information on accounts held by Banev and his associates in response to a request from Bulgaria, the source added.Noticing a series of withdrawals, the bank's compliance department asked prosecutors whether to freeze the accounts, but were told not to do so in order not to tip the clients off, according to the source. VIDEO3:1903:19There needs to be more disclosure by family offices: Vanity Fair's William CohanSquawk on the StreetBy the time prosecutors gave Credit Suisse the go-ahead, much of the money had been withdrawn.The prosecutors' office declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was now in the hands of the court.The second indictment filed by federal prosecutors against the former relationship manager at Julius Baer, which is being tried in the same court case, alleges some of the funds were transferred to another Swiss bank.The former relationship manager, who left a few months after the transfers took place, is charged with facilitating money laundering.The bank had refused to accept a suitcase filled with cash from the defendants, the indictment says.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Friday, April 1, 2022 
Man Sentenced to 46 Months in Prison for Firearm Offenses
An Alabama man was sentenced today to 46 months in prison for federal and local firearms offenses stemming from the discovery of weapons in his pickup truck parked near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
Lonnie Leroy Coffman, 72, of Falkville, Alabama, was sentenced today to 46 months in prison after pleading guilty to federal and local firearms offenses stemming from the discovery of weapons in his pickup truck parked near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
According to court documents, Coffman traveled from Alabama to the District of Columbia several days prior to Jan. 6, 2021. He parked his red GMC Sierra pickup truck in the 300 block of First Street SE, on the morning of Jan. 6. Less than half a mile away in the U.S. Capitol Building, a joint session of the U.S. Congress was scheduled to meet in the afternoon to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the presidential election.
Coffman admitted in his plea agreement that he exited the pickup truck at 9:20 a.m. and walked in the direction of the U.S. Capitol Building, and towards a rally near the National Mall. Inside the pickup truck were several loaded firearms within arms-reach of the driver’s seat, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, a crossbow with bolts, machetes, camouflage smoke devices, a stun gun, and a cooler containing 11 mason jars filled with ignitable ingredients for Molotov cocktail incendiary weapons. Coffman also carried a loaded handgun and a loaded revolver as he walked around the area that day. A search of Coffman’s residence in Alabama later that month led to the discovery of 12 additional mason jars containing ignitable substances, each constituting the component parts of Molotov cocktails.
Coffman did not have a license to carry a pistol in the District of Columbia and had not registered any firearms or destructive devices in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, as required by law.
Coffman has been in custody since his arrest on Jan. 6, 2021. Coffman will be placed on three years of supervised release following his prison term.
Coffman was sentenced in the District of Columbia by the Honorable Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in two separate criminal cases, one brought in the District of Columbia on Jan. 7, 2021, and the other brought in the Northern District of Alabama and transferred to the District of Columbia for purposes of plea and sentencing. Coffman had pleaded guilty on Nov. 12, 2021, to two counts of possession of an unregistered firearm, a federal offense, regarding the component parts of Molotov cocktails discovered in his pickup truck in Washington, D.C., and at his residence in Alabama. Coffman also pleaded guilty to carrying a pistol without a license, a District of Columbia offense. Judge Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him to 46 months in prison on each of the federal offenses, and 15 months on the District of Columbia offense, with the time running concurrently.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Friedman for the District of Columbia and Henry Cornelius for the Northern District of Alabama prosecuted the case, with valuable assistance provided by Trial Attorney Taryn Meeks of the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section.
The case was investigated by the FBI’s Birmingham and Washington Field Offices, and the U.S. Capitol Police.

31st Jan 2022
The biggest fraud and money laundering cases




 





Share





 



Money laundering and fraud can have a severe impact on everyone from regular citizens to multinational corporations. In fact, the National Crime Agency puts the cost of money laundering and fraud to British businesses, citizens and government at over £190 billion a year[1].As you might expect, there have been some extraordinary examples of these crimes over the years. We have analysed 10 of the most lucrative (and shocking!) cases, to reveal exactly what happened and how businesses and individuals can learn from these cases moving into 2020:1.	‘Mr Big’ After serving a three-year prison sentence for laundering drug money[2], Maythem Al-Ansari, aka ‘Mr Big’, was staring down the barrel of an additional jail term for a mortgage fraud that cost millions of pounds. However, after handing over his passport as part of the bail terms, an error allowed Al-Ansari to acquire another passport from the Home Office, which he used to flee to Syria. Eventually Mr Big gave himself up at London Heathrow in 2016, but the blunder was highly embarrassing at the time and left millions of pounds unaccounted for. Of course, this was a high profile case and this kind of error rarely occurs, but it highlights the necessity of government bodies to continue working closely together to avoid lapses in communication that allow such issues to happen. 2.	Largest ever visa fraud in the UKFour people were sentenced in September 2019 at Southwark Crown Court[3] for being behind the UK’s largest ever visa and immigration fraud case. The culprits impersonated ‘immigration advisors’ who charged extortionate fees for compiling (false) immigration applications that would’ve cost millions of pounds to the British taxpayer had the scam come off. It’s imperative that those looking to migrate to the United Kingdom only go through the proper, official channels to avoid any chance of being defrauded. 3.	Failings at Standard Chartered Bank For a vast series of failings including opening a bank account with 3 million UAE Dirham (£500,000) deposited from cash in a suitcase, the Financial Conduct Authority issued its second-largest fine[4] to Standard Chartered Bank in April 2019 of just over £102 million.Businesses, particularly those in the banking and financial sector, must take an active approach in identifying money laundering risks and reporting these without hesitation to the relevant authorities. Complying with money laundering legislation will save companies money in the long run as any fines for breaches would eclipse resulting fines. 4.	The worst female fraudster in the UKAptly dubbed by police as the “UK’s most prolific female fraudster”[5], Maria Michaela scammed banks out of £13 million by submitting offers on houses over the market value and then defaulting on the mortgages. Michaela was able to repeat this several times by using false identities.This highlights how important it is that mortgage lenders take a close, critical look at offers that come in well over the asking price. Many offers of this nature will be genuine, but sometimes they are too good to be true. 5.	Luxury accessories, 500 lottery tickets and even bars of gold Police tracked a series of dubious purchases by Stephen Burton, before raiding his home in February 2019[6], uncovering a vast collection of possessions with a value of almost £1 million. These included solid gold bars, designer watches, thousands of pounds and euros, 500 lottery tickets and false identities. Police were able to ‘follow the money’ in this case, as purchases that are beyond the means of ‘average citizens’ are often indicators that fraudulent behaviour is taking place. 6.	Suitcase smugglingIn November 2019[7], police arrested ten suspected members of an organised crime gang, under suspicion of smuggling £15.5 million pounds out of the UK to Dubai in suitcases. 

This is another example of the authorities building a case around suspected illegal activity, in this instance unusual travel patterns and living well above one’s means, and acting upon their investigations. 7.	Big-time benefit fraud Following the death of her father in 2004, Ethel McGill[8] continued to claim his war pension and benefits by claiming he was still alive, at one point convincing a friend to lay down under a blanket to impersonate Mr Dennison.  McGill also faked disability and dementia for over two decades but investigators at the Department for Work and Pensions acquired videos of her driving and moving around, despite her claims of needing a wheelchair. Everyday people are often able to help in cases like this, so if you know about a fraudulent situation then reporting it to the relevant authorities can really help. 8.	Bank of Scotland’s scandalHundreds of people were left in serious financial difficulty due to rogue employees at Bank of Scotland’s (HBOS) Reading branch colluding with consultants to defraud small businesses of around £245 million between 2003 and 2007[9].The scam involved referring small businesses to a ‘turnaround consultancy’, which would convince the businesses they needed help, before loading them with astronomical debts and fees. For failing to disclose information about the activity, HBOS was fined over £45 million.Small businesses should always proceed with caution when being passed over to outside consultancies without seeking their own, independent advice. 9.	Four cases and lots of cash In 2019 Mohamed Imran Khan Sathar Khan, then 36, was caught by Border Force operatives trying to smuggle £1.5 million in four suitcases to Dubai[10]. Each case weighed exactly 20kg, which savvy border guards were able to recognise as suspicious before searching the cases and rumbling the fraudster.This is a great example of authorities spotting a strange pattern and acting on their suspicions. With such situations, it is always better to be safe than sorry.  10.	Huge fine for Commonwealth Bank In 2018 Australia’s largest lender, Commonwealth Bank, agreed to pay a whopping £400 million fine[11], the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history, for breach of anti money laundering and counter-terror financing legislation. In total, there were 53,000 suspicious transactions that weren’t reported to the relevant authorities by the bank. According to Commonwealth, this was due to a coding error preventing the automatic reporting of transactions that may be indicative of illegal activity. Companies in the financial and banking sectors should continually monitor and proactively troubleshoot their software to ensure it is recording data and reporting accurately and efficiently, or else risk being faced with huge fines and repercussions.Here we have picked out just ten of the most high-profile examples of money laundering and fraud, but these are the tip of the iceberg. These cases are continuously occurring and those that are on a smaller scale most likely won’t make the news. The size of the problem is enormous, costing British citizens, businesses and government hundreds of billions of pounds each year. Looking at prominent cases does serve a purpose in that it highlights the issue and can raise awareness of money laundering and fraud, and may help businesses understand how to better protect themselves against such crimes. To find out more on how SmartSearch can help your business, please visit: https://www.smartsearch.com/product/overviewReferences: [1]https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/national-economic-crime-centre-leads-push-to-identify-money-laundering-activity[2]https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/criminal-mr-big-on-run-with-10m-after-disastrous-passport-blunder-8209073.html [3]https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/four-sentenced-their-part-uks-largest-ever-visa-fraud

WorldAsian News InternationalUpdated: April 01, 2022 12:09 am ISTImran Khan had claimed that the threatening letter had been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Washington: The United States on Thursday rejected insinuations made by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan regarding Washington's role in an alleged ""foreign conspiracy"" to oust him from power.""There is no truth to these allegations. We are closely following developments in Pakistan. We respect and support Pakistan's constitutional process and the rule of law,"" a US State Department spokesperson told ANI.The Pakistan Prime Minister reiterated his claims of 'foreign conspiracy' in the country, saying that a foreign nation is trying to oust him over the ""independent"" foreign policy choices made by him.Addressing the people of Pakistan, ahead of the no-confidence motion, Imran claimed a foreign nation sent a message that Imran Khan needs to be removed else the country will suffer consequences.""The United States"", Imran Khan said in a slip of the tongue and then stated that ""a foreign country"" had sent a ""threatening memo"" which was against the Pakistani nation.""On March 8 or before that on March 7, the US sent us a...not the US but a foreign country sent us a message. The reason why I am talking about this...for an independent country to receive such a message... this is against me and the country,"" he said.Imran Khan said the memo was against him, not against the government. ""...it stated that if the no-confidence motion passes, Pakistan will be forgiven, if not, there will be consequences.""Pakistan PM earlier shared the contents of a secret letter that was in news last week when he informed a public meeting that his government had received threats from abroad.Imran Khan had claimed that the threatening letter had been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Pakistan media reports said that letter is the word-for-word transcript of a conversation between the diplomats of Pakistan and another country sent to Pakistan's Foreign Ministry.Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Imran Khan has ""nowhere to run"" less than an hour after proceedings of the National Assembly of Pakistan were adjourned.This remark comes as proceedings of the Pakistan National Assembly were adjourned till April 3. The session was held with more than 172 members from the Opposition benches in attendance.During a press conference, Bilawal said Imran Khan again used the Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, Asad Qaiser to defer the proceedings of the no-confidence motion.""Today, by producing 175 lawmakers in the Parliament we have proved that Imran Khan has nowhere to run,"" he said. ""Now that we have a majority, there is no safe passage (for Imran Khan), there is no face-saving way and there is no backdoor,"" he said.The PPP chairman suggested that there is only one ""honourable"" way out for Imran Khan: to resign in a bid to end the political crisis in the country.PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)Also Read5 Big Points On Pakistan's Intensifying Political CrisisPak No-Trust Vote: Opposition Says Government Violated Constitution""You Decide Nation's Destiny"": Imran Khan In Address To People Of PakTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world.

Considerations for Strengthening Sanctions/AML Compliance
Executive Summary
In this memorandum, we survey 2021 U.S. economic sanctions and anti-money laundering (“AML”) developments and trends and provide an outlook for 2022. We also provide thoughts on compliance and risk mitigation measures for what we expect will continue to be a challenging regulatory environment. 
These areas saw significant activity last year as President Biden relied on economic sanctions as a primary national security and foreign policy tool. While the Biden Administration’s approach to sanctions may be characterized as more measured than that of the prior administration, the Biden Administration has nonetheless made significant changes to the sanctions landscape during its first year, standing up new sanctions programs, revamping certain existing programs, and making significant designations under existing authorities. 
In its first year, the Biden Administration stood up or expanded sanctions against Belarus, Burma/Myanmar, and Ethiopia; retained but revamped the Chinese Military Company sanctions; and revoked the Trump Administration’s sanctions against the International Criminal Court (“ICC”) . The Biden Administration has also taken steps to navigate the sanctions-related impacts of the Afghan government falling under the control of the Taliban, a designated terrorist group, and is continuing to extend and explore additional sanctions against Russia in reaction to election interference and Russia’s ongoing escalation and threatened military action against Ukraine. All told, in 2021 the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) made over 853 new designations under its various sanctions programs, including over 170 designations under its Global Magnitsky sanctions, which target corruption and human rights abuses worldwide. OFAC also issued over 41 new or amended general licenses, and announced 20 public enforcement actions, including its second crypto-related action and a rare action against an individual. OFAC also delisted over 700 individuals and entities from its SDN List, reflecting OFAC’s commitment that sanctions are a tool whose goal is to change behavior rather than to punish.
In addition, Congress made the most significant change to the Bank Secrecy Act since the Patriot Act by passing the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (“AML Act”), which FinCEN is in the process of implementing. On the enforcement front, federal and state agencies imposed nearly $630 million in penalties for sanctions/AML violations last year, as compared to nearly $960 million in 2020 and $2.4 billion in 2019, reflecting both a smaller number of enforcement actions and a lack of large, multi-agency resolutions with financial institutions.
U.S. agencies also issued a flurry of guidance and advisories, once again raising expectations for private sector compliance efforts. This guidance encompasses a wide range of topics, including sanctions risks associated with the virtual currency industry, facilitating ransomware payments, conducting business in Cambodia or the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (“Xinjiang” or the “Xinjiang province”) of China, and the impacts of China’s actions in Hong Kong. FinCEN also issued guidance, reports, and proposed regulations as it worked to implement the AML Act. 
This memorandum also surveys the numerous actions taken in 2021 focused on the risks of certain non-U.S.-origin technologies and non-U.S. malicious cyber actors, including those linked to China. These actions included the revocation of Trump-era executive orders concerning WeChat and TikTok and a new framework for determining the national security risks posed by mobile apps, developments related to the Information and Communications Technology and Services (“ICTS”) executive order and implementing regulations, and the Infrastructure as a Service executive order and rulemaking.
Congress Enacts the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020
On January 1, 2021, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (“AML Act”) became law when Congress overrode President Trump’s veto of the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act.[1]  The AML Act is a sweeping law that constitutes the most significant amendment to the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) since the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. Some of the most notable parts of the Act are as follows: 

The Corporate Transparency Act (“CTA”)[2] establishes a federal standard for beneficial ownership reporting requirements for corporations, limited liability companies, and similar entities formed within the United States, as well as such entities formed outside of the United States but registered to do business in the United States.[3] Businesses that are exempt from the new reporting requirements include publicly traded entities, financial institutions, and companies that have (i) 20 or more full-time employees, (ii) $5 million or more in annual revenue, and (iii) a physical office in the United States.[4]  On December 7, 2021, FinCEN issued a proposed rule to implement these provisions.
The AML Act also establishes national supervision and compliance priorities to combat money laundering and terrorist financing; creates a public-private information sharing partnership known as the FinCEN Exchange;[5] and applies the Bank Secrecy Act to antiquities dealers.[6] As discussed below, FinCEN is in the process of promulgating regulations to implement these priorities.[7]  The AML Act also calls for Treasury to study the facilitation of money laundering and terrorist financing through trade in works of art, including the extent the facilitation of money laundering and terror finance through the trade in art enters or affects the U.S. financial system and the parameters of potential regulations on trade in works of art. On February 4, 2022, Treasury issued the study, which concluded that there is some evidence of money laundering risk in the high-value art market, and emphasized the potential emerging risks associated with digital art, including non-fungible tokens that are commonly called NFTs. [8]  
 The AML Act also mandates the Secretary of Treasury to study and update annual BSA reporting requirements, adds additional considerations for suspicious activity reporting requirements, and streamlines requirements for currency transaction reports and suspicious activity reports.[9] In addition, the AML Act expands subpoena power over foreign banks that maintain correspondent accounts in the United States. Under the AML Act, Treasury, and DOJ may now request records relating to either the correspondent account or any other account at the foreign bank, including records maintained outside of the United States, that are the subject of a criminal, BSA, or civil forfeiture action.[10]

Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
The Biden Administration continued to ratchet up sanctions against China. Additionally, last year saw important changes to other sanctions programs administered by OFAC, including new or revamped programs against Belarus, Burma, and Ethiopia. The Biden Administration also continued to make use of the Global Magnitsky Sanctions to target human rights abuses and corruption worldwide, and increased sanctions pressure against Russia. President Biden appointed Brian Nelson as the Treasury Department’s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in 2021, and Andrea Gacki remains the OFAC Director.[11]
Changes to Sanctions Programs
2021 China Developments. On June 3, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order entitled “Addressing the Threat From Securities Investments that Finance Certain Companies of the People’s Republic of China” (the “2021 EO”),[12] which revises and supersedes President Trump’s Executive Order 13959 that (along with a subsequent amendment) created the “Communist Chinese Military Companies” (“CCMCs”) sanctions program (the “2020 CCMC EO”). As discussed in our prior memorandum,[13] the 2020 CCMC EO prohibited (subject to certain exceptions) U.S. persons from transacting in the publicly traded securities of Chinese companies that the Department of Defense (“DOD”) had identified as CCMCs and that were subsequently listed on OFAC’s CCMC List. 
Public reporting indicates that the Biden Administration had a two-fold rationale for revising the 2020 CCMC EO. First, the expansion of the designation criteria to now include companies that “operate or have operated” in the Chinese surveillance technology sector is intended to show an increased U.S. government commitment to combatting alleged Chinese repression and human rights abuses.[14] Second, the Biden Administration issued the 2021 EO to put these sanctions on stronger footing, given that two designations under the prior EO had been successfully challenged in court (at the preliminary injunction stage).[15]  The 2021 EO replaces the prior EO’s criteria for designation in their entirety and authorizes the imposition of sanctions against those that operate or have operated in the defense and related materiel sector or the surveillance technology sector of the economy of China, or are owned or controlled by any such person. The 2021 EO included an Annex listing 59 companies that were added to OFAC’s non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List (the “NS-CMIC List”) and that became subject to the prohibitions on August 2, 2021. In December 2021, OFAC added an additional eight Chinese technology companies to the NS-CMIC list for “actively support[ing] the biometric surveillance and tracking of ethnic and religious minorities in China, particularly the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang.”[16]
Additionally, in 2021 OFAC continued to implement sanctions required pursuant to the Hong Kong Autonomy Act (“HKAA”), which became law in 2020. As discussed in our prior memorandum,[17] the HKAA authorizes OFAC to impose sanctions on any non-U.S. persons that are found to be involved in the undermining of Hong Kong’s autonomy as well as on any foreign financial institutions (“FFIs”) that engage in certain “significant” transactions with such identified non-U.S. persons. In January 2021, OFAC published a final rule implementing the Hong Kong-Related Sanctions Regulations.[18] 
In March 2021, the Department of State identified an additional 24 persons that it had determined to be contributing to the undermining of Hong Kong’s autonomy, meaning that any foreign financial institutions (“FFIs”) that engaged in certain transactions with such persons could be the target of U.S. sanctions (the 24 persons identified in the State Department’s report had already been added to the SDN List in December 2020).[19]  In May 2021, OFAC published a report required by the HKAA regarding whether any FFI had engaged in a “significant” transaction with any of the 24 persons or the persons that the State Department had previously identified in its October 2020 report.[20]  The report concluded that no FFI had engaged in such transactions with any of the identified persons. 
On July 16, 2021, OFAC placed an additional seven Chinese officials on the SDN List pursuant to the HKAA.[21] On December 20, 2021, the Department of State issued a report that identified five of those seven persons as contributing to the undermining of Hong Kong’s autonomy, meaning that any FFIs that engage in certain transactions with such persons could be the target of U.S. sanctions.[22] As a result of the State Department’s publication of this report, the HKAA requires OFAC to publish an updated report regarding whether any FFIs have engaged in a “significant” transaction with any person identified by the State Department within 90 days (i.e., by March 20, 2022).
Burma/Myanmar. On February 1, 2021, the Burmese military announced that it had seized control of the country from Burma’s democratically elected government. In response, the Biden Administration (1) issued Executive Order 14014, authorizing sanctions targeting the Burmese military, its leaders, and their business interests;[23] (2) implemented new export controls; and (3) pursued means to prevent the Burmese military from accessing government funds held in the United States. During the course of 2021, the Biden Administration designated a number of individuals and entities connected to the Burmese military under the new executive order. Other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union have also imposed sanctions against the Burmese military regime. The broader government of Burma has not been placed on the SDN list. 
Belarus. In 2021, the Biden Administration continued to sanction individuals and entities pursuant to Executive Order 13405 in response to the escalating violence and repression in Belarus following the reelection of President Lukashenko in 2020, which the U.S. government declared as fraudulent and which resulted in widespread protests in Belarus.[24]  In April 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14038, which authorizes new sanctions on persons responsible for suppressing democracy and other freedoms in Belarus, including individuals responsible for Lukashenko’s election.  Pursuant to that authority, OFAC in December issued Directive 1, which imposes restrictions on dealings in new issuances of Belarusian sovereign debt in the primary and secondary markets. These restrictions are broadly similar to portions of OFAC’s existing sectoral sanctions targeting Russia.[25]  OFAC also revoked a longstanding general license that had authorized dealings with certain Belarus SDNs. 
Iran. Prior to taking office, President Biden stated that he would pursue a renewal in some form of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (“JCPOA”)—the Iran nuclear deal that the United States joined under President Obama and withdrew from under President Trump. In early 2021, the United States and Iran engaged in initial discussions but ultimately suspended negotiations prior to the June 2021 election of new Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, a critic of the JCPOA. Although indirect talks resumed in November, the parties have not reached an agreement and no deal appears imminent. 
Afghanistan. In August 2021, the Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (“SDGT”), with support from related groups including the Haqqani Network, which is designated as an SDGT and a Foreign Terrorist Organization (“FTO”), took effective control of the government of Afghanistan.[26]  Many individual members of the Taliban, Haqqani Network, and other related groups active in Afghanistan are designated as SDGTs, FTOs, or SDNs, and have been appointed to various government positions throughout Afghanistan. OFAC has added a number of Afghan individuals to the SDN List under various existing sanctions programs, including the Counter Terrorism, Kingpin Act, Counter Narcotics, and Transnational Criminal Organizations program designations.
A designated organization seizing control of the government of a country is an unusual development and the situation in Afghanistan, as well as U.S. foreign policy toward Afghanistan, are continuing to evolve. Although OFAC issued an FAQ[27] in September 2021 in part to clarify that Afghanistan is not currently the target of comprehensive U.S. sanctions, OFAC has not yet issued guidance on whether the Taliban’s SDGT designation renders the current government of Afghanistan blocked. This can present meaningful complexity and risk in determining whether private or government entities may be owned or controlled by designated individuals or entities and whether designated individuals may be employed by or acting on behalf of such entities.  
Nevertheless, OFAC has issued several General Licenses authorizing certain activities involving the Taliban and the Haqqani Network that it typically authorizes in the context of a designated regime. These general licenses authorize certain activities related to the official business of the United States, certain nongovernmental organizations’ activities in Afghanistan, and official activities of certain international organizations. In an attempt to ensure that U.S. sanctions do not limit the ability of civilians located in Afghanistan to receive humanitarian support, OFAC issued general licenses authorizing the provision of certain humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan and other activities that support basic human needs in Afghanistan, as well as certain transactions related to the exportation or re-exportation of agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices (as well as replacement parts, components, and software updates for medical devices). Notably, these general licenses authorize financial transfers to the Taliban or the Haqqani Network for “the purpose of effecting the payment of taxes, fees, or import duties, or the purchase or receipt of permits, licenses, or public utility services related to the activities specified” in the general licenses.[28]
Russia. In 2021, OFAC took multiple actions against Russian individuals and entities related to attempted interference with the 2020 U.S. presidential election. On January 11, 2021, OFAC designated seven individuals and four entities that are part of a Russia-linked foreign influence network associated with Andrii Derkach, a Russian agent who was designated last year for his attempt to influence the election.[29]  On April 15, 2021, President Biden signed Executive Order 14024, which expanded the U.S. government’s ability to impose sanctions against persons associated with the Russian government for their malicious cyber activities against the United States.[30]  Pursuant to this authority, OFAC designated several companies operating in the technology sector of the Russian economy that OFAC determined support the Russian Intelligence Services.
OFAC also took multiple actions against Russia in response to Russia’s poisoning and subsequent imprisonment of Russian opposition figure Aleksey Navalny. On March 2, 2021, OFAC designated numerous individuals, including Russian government officials, and Russian entities.[31]  Additionally, on August 20, 2021, OFAC designated nine Russian individuals and two Russian entities involved in Navalny’s poisoning or Russia’s chemical weapons program.[32]
On August 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order entitled “Blocking Property with Respect to Certain Russian Energy Export Pipelines,” which authorizes the Secretaries of the Treasury and State to further implement sanctions under the Protecting Europe’s Energy Security Act of 2019 (“PEESA”).[33]  PEESA requires the imposition of sanctions with respect to the provision of vessels engaged in specified activities for the construction of certain Russian energy export pipelines.
Finally, OFAC designated five individuals and three entities related to Russia’s occupation of the Crimea region of Ukraine and its human rights abuses against the local population.[34]  This action was taken in partnership with the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. OFAC also designated additional individuals and entities under existing sanctions programs, including Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), Russian Harmful Foreign Activities, Non-proliferation, Cyber-related, PEESA, and Counter Terrorism designations.
Ethiopia. On September 17, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14046, which established a new sanctions program targeting those “responsible for or complicit in actions or policies that are prolonging the conflict in northern Ethiopia” or that “commit human rights abuses [] or obstruct humanitarian access and a ceasefire.”  The executive order cast the ongoing military conflict in the country as having “sparked one of the worst humanitarian and human rights crises in the world,” risking “a wider civil war that threatens Ethiopia and regional stability.”[35]  The Biden Administration subsequently designated four entities and two individuals as SDNs, including the Eritrean military, the sole legal political party in Ethiopia (“PFDJ”), and related entities. Importantly, and in a departure from other blocking programs, the executive order provides that OFAC’s 50 percent rule does not automatically apply to entities owned by SDNs designated pursuant to the Order. The executive order also provides for a menu of non-blocking sanctions, including debt and equity restrictions, prohibitions on U.S. financial institution provision of loans or credit, and prohibitions on transactions in foreign exchange subject to U.S. jurisdiction.
Removal of ICC Sanctions. On April 1, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14022, terminating the sanctions that had been imposed by President Trump in June 2020 with regard to the International Criminal Court (“ICC”).[36]  President Biden stated that those sanctions were not “an effective or appropriate strategy for addressing the United States’ concerns with the ICC.”[37]  On July 6, 2021, OFAC issued a final rule removing the ICC Sanctions Program.[38]
Amendment of Enforcement Penalty Amounts/Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act. Consistent with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, and the Federal Civil Penalties Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, OFAC announced on March 17, 2021 amendments to its regulations to adjust for inflation its civil monetary penalties assessed for failure to comply with U.S. sanctions programs as well as certain sanctions-related recordkeeping and reporting requirements.[39]  The amendments raised the applicable statutory maximum civil penalty amounts to $311,562 per violation for IEEPA violations and $91,816 per violation for TWEA violations.[40]  The penalties for violations of sanctions administered pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 were increased to $82,244, and penalties for violations of the sanctions administered pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act were increased to $1,548,075.[41]  The applicable penalties for various OFAC administered recordkeeping violations were increased to between $1,203 and $60,226, depending on the type of recordkeeping violation.[42]
Guidance
2021 Sanctions Review. Marking the transition from the Trump Administration to the Biden Administration, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo led a review of OFAC sanctions, consulting with a variety of private entities and other stakeholders. On October 18, 2021, the Treasury Department released a short report on the results of the review, which included five recommendations to preserve and enhance sanctions’ effectiveness.[43]  First, the review recommended the adoption of a “structured policy framework” that links sanctions to a clear policy objective. This framework would ask whether a sanctions action: (a) supports a clear policy objective within a broader U.S. government strategy; (b) has been assessed to be the right tool for the circumstances; (c) incorporates anticipated economic and political implications for the sanctions target(s), U.S. economy, allies, and third parties, and has been calibrated to mitigate unintended impacts; (d) includes a multilateral coordination and engagement strategy; and (e) will be easily understood, enforceable, and, where possible, reversible. Second, the review recommended incorporating multilateral, international coordination, where possible. Third, the review recommended calibrating sanctions to mitigate unintended economic, political, and humanitarian impacts, specifically noting the potential impacts on U.S. small businesses. Fourth, the review recommended ensuring that sanctions are easily understood, enforceable, and adaptable, by enhancing the Treasury’s public messaging and engagement with key audiences and by coordinating with the Department of State. Fifth, the review recommended investing in modernizing Treasury’s sanctions technology, workforce, and infrastructure. Specifically, the review indicated that digital currencies and other modern technologies “potentially reduce the efficacy of American sanctions.”   To combat this, the Department of Treasury plans to build on its existing outreach and engagement capabilities in the digital assets space, as well as increase its overall knowledge and capabilities in the area. The review does not address whether current sanctions meet the goals of the recommended framework or offer guidance as to how Treasury will implement the review’s findings. 
OFAC’s tailored guidance for the cryptocurrency industry. As described in a separate memorandum,[44] on October 15, 2021, OFAC published tailored guidance for the cryptocurrency industry that highlights sanctions compliance requirements and provides industry-specific advice regarding OFAC’s compliance expectations.[45]  OFAC simultaneously issued two new FAQs relevant to the cryptocurrency industry. A few days later, on October 19, 2021, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo requested additional funding from Congress to combat national security threats, including those arising from the cryptocurrency markets.[46]  These actions, together with several recent U.S. government enforcement actions, signal increased U.S. government efforts to address the sanctions risks posed by the emerging virtual currency sector. The key takeaways from OFAC’s cryptocurrency guidance are as follows:

OFAC made clear, once again, that sanctions compliance obligations “apply equally to transactions involving virtual currency and those involving fiat currency.”
OFAC went on to provide specific sanctions-related best practices for actors in the cryptocurrency space, such as appropriate internal controls and examples of risk indicators or red flags in the cryptocurrency space. OFAC flagged certain internal controls such as screening, investigation, and transactional monitoring, including know your customer (“KYC”) procedures and use of geolocational tools such as IP blocking. With respect to IP blocking, OFAC also expressed an expectation that companies would employ technologies to detect IP manipulation that is designed to defeat blocking. 
The new OFAC FAQs clarify how U.S. persons can meet their obligations to block virtual currency under OFAC’s regulations. 

OFAC Designation of SUEX and Chatex. As described in a separate memorandum,[47] on September 21, 2021, OFAC made its first designation of a cryptocurrency exchange, SUEX OTC, S.R.R. (“SUEX”), for SUEX’s role in facilitating financial transactions for ransomware actors.[48]  OFAC determined that SUEX facilitated transactions that involved illicit proceeds from eight ransomware variants.[49]  Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen emphasized that “[a]s cyber criminals use increasingly sophisticated methods and technology, we are committed to using the full range of measures, to include sanctions and regulatory tools, to disrupt, deter, and prevent ransomware attacks.”[50]
On November 8, 2021, OFAC designated another cryptocurrency exchange, Chatex, and its associated support network. Similar to SUEX, Chatex facilitated financial transactions for ransomware actors. In fact, Chatex has close ties to SUEX, in that it used SUEX’s function as a nested exchange to facilitate transactions.[51] 
Advisory on Potential Sanctions Risks for Facilitating Ransomware Payments. In September 2021, OFAC issued an advisory to highlight the sanctions risks associated with ransomware payments in connection with malicious cyber-enabled activities.[52]  The advisory warns that facilitating a ransomware payment may enable bad actors, including those that are or are related to sanctioned persons, to advance their illicit aims, including funding activities adverse to the national security and foreign policy objectives of the United States. Therefore, the advisory strongly discourages the payment of ransomware demands. It also notes that facilitating ransomware payments could potentially violate OFAC regulations if the recipient is a sanctioned person or located in a comprehensively sanctioned jurisdiction. The advisory discusses steps companies can take to mitigate such risks, including actions that OFAC would consider to be “mitigating factors” in any related enforcement action. For example, the advisory notes that adopting or improving cybersecurity practices such as those highlighted in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (“CISA”) September 2020 Ransomware Guide will be considered as a mitigating factor in an OFAC enforcement response, including: (i) maintaining offline backups of data, (ii) developing incident response plans, (iii) instituting cybersecurity training, (iv) regularly updating antivirus and anti-malware software, and (v) employing authentication protocols. Another mitigating factor OFAC will consider is whether a company reports a ransomware attack “as soon as possible after discovery of an attack” to appropriate U.S. government agencies and the extent of cooperation with OFAC or other agencies, including whether an apparent violation of U.S. sanctions is voluntarily self-disclosed. Finally, the advisory provides a list of government agencies that are investigating ransomware attacks and resources for companies related to reporting and preventing a ransomware attack.
Updated Xinjiang Supply Chain Business Advisory. On July 13, 2021, the Departments of State, Commerce, Homeland Security, Labor, and Treasury, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative issued an updated advisory on the risks for businesses with potential exposure in their supply chain to entities engaged in human rights abuses in the Xinjiang province. The advisory states that businesses and individuals should be aware of the significant reputational, economic, and legal risks of involvement with entities or individuals in or linked to Xinjiang that engage in human rights abuses, including but not limited to forced labor and intrusive surveillance. The advisory identifies several activities related to Xinjiang internal surveillance that could trigger risks, including but not limited to: investment or involvement in joint ventures with PRC companies or government officials that are directly or indirectly linked to surveillance in Xinjiang; selling or providing any goods, software, or technology used in the supply chain of biometrics devices, items intended for surveillance, or items used for genetic collection and analysis; and the provision of services to internment camps or training of Xinjiang authorities, police, or PRC officials that enable arbitrary detention or surveillance on the basis of ethnic group, religion, or protected class. It also identifies several potential indicators of the use of forced labor in Chinese entities including, among other things, a lack of transparency, the disclosure of high revenue with very few employees paying into the Chinese government’s social insurance program, and the location of factories near internment camps or adjacent to industrial parks engaged in so-called “poverty alleviation” efforts. 
Cambodia Business Advisory on High-Risk Investments and Interactions. In November 2021, OFAC, along with the Departments of State and Commerce, issued an advisory to caution U.S. businesses currently operating in or considering operating in Cambodia to be mindful of interactions with entities and sectors potentially involved in human rights abuses, criminal activities, and corrupt business practices.[53]  The advisory addressed two areas of risk exposure. The first is illicit finance activities in Cambodia and related risks for the financial, real estate, casino, and infrastructure sectors. The second is involvement with Cambodian entities involved in trafficking in persons, wildlife, and narcotics, including entities and individuals that are designated on the SDN List, and related risks for the manufacturing and timber sectors. Regarding the first area of concern, the advisory discusses limited regulations and oversight for the financial, casino, and real estate sectors; proliferation finance risks related to North Korea; ongoing human rights abuses; high levels of corruption; and poor supervision of the financial sector in Cambodia. The advisory also warns of money laundering in these sectors. In the second area, the advisory encourages businesses to consider the threats of human trafficking and child exploitation, particularly when investing in the tourism industry, noting that official actions by the government are not sufficient to meet the minimum standards of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.
Hong Kong Business Advisory. On July 16, 2021, the Departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, and Homeland Security issued an advisory on the risks for businesses operating in Hong Kong in connection with the imposition of the People’s Republic of China Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (the “National Security Law”).[54]   The advisory states that, in June 2020, China unilaterally imposed the National Security Law on Hong Kong, significantly reducing Hong Kong’s autonomy and undermining protected rights and freedoms. The advisory goes on to note that, in addition to establishing offenses for individuals such as secession, subversion, terrorist activities, and collusion with a foreign country, the National Security Law states that a company or organization that commits a violation may be subject to a criminal fine, suspension of operations, or having its license or business application revoked, even if the offense is committed outside of Hong Kong. The advisory states that businesses and individuals that operate in Hong Kong should be aware of reputational, economic, and legal risks after the imposition of the National Security Law and the imposition of U.S. sanctions targeting a number of PRC and Hong Kong government officials who were involved in the drafting and imposition of the National Security Law. In addition to the risk of criminal penalties for committing a violation of the National Security Law, the advisory also noted other risks associated with doing business in Hong Kong, including (i) electronic surveillance without warrants and the surrender of data to PRC or Hong Kong authorities; (ii) risks regarding transparency and access to critical business information due to restrictions on the press in Hong Kong; and (iii) the risk of potential PRC retaliation against companies that comply with sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries, including through enforcement of China’s Countering Foreign Sanctions Law, which authorizes the imposition of countermeasures in response to sanctions imposed on Chinese individuals and entities by foreign governments. The advisory notes that the countermeasures authorized by the Countering Foreign Sanctions Law include (i) not issuing visas, denying entry, canceling visas, or deportation; (ii) sealing, seizing, or freezing movable property, real estate, and all other types of property, (iii) prohibiting or restricting relevant transactions, cooperation, and other activities with organizations and individuals, and (iv) other measures determined to be necessary by the PRC.
Enforcement Actions
OFAC penalties for 2021 reached nearly $21 million, roughly equivalent to 2020, but significantly less than 2019 when OFAC imposed over $1.28 billion in penalties. OFAC’s 20 public enforcement actions highlight the agency’s broad assertion of jurisdiction and its increasing focus on non-financial companies. Among other areas, OFAC had several actions emphasizing the applicability of its sanctions to dealings with the U.S. financial system and in U.S. origin goods (including software), the involvement of U.S. persons in the activities of their non-U.S. affiliates, the importance of oversight over non-U.S. subsidiaries, the hazards of relying on automated screening solutions that are not appropriately calibrated, and the importance of understanding the scope of OFAC’s sanctions and any applicable general licenses. OFAC’s enforcement actions also reflected an increased focus on the technology sector, and OFAC representatives have noted that OFAC expects large, global technology companies to develop appropriately sophisticated sanctions compliance programs. OFAC also reached its second settlement with a cryptocurrency firm, making clear that OFAC views dealings in cryptocurrency for the benefit of sanctioned persons or jurisdictions as constituting a violation of U.S. sanctions.  OFAC also continued to make use of Findings of Violation, public enforcement actions that involve no assessment of a monetary penalty. 
Below, we survey the key OFAC enforcement actions from 2021, grouped by category or theme.
Use of the U.S. Financial System.
For years, OFAC and DOJ enforcement focused on banks—and not other parties that were conducting transactions with sanctioned jurisdictions or parties that involved the U.S. financial system. However, in 2017, OFAC made clear through its enforcement action against Singaporean entity CSE Global Limited and its subsidiary CSE TransTel Pte. Ltd. that non-U.S. companies can violate U.S. sanctions by initiating U.S. dollar (“USD”) payments that cause U.S.-based banks or branches to violate sanctions by engaging in the prohibited exportation of financial services from the United States for the benefit of sanctioned parties or jurisdictions. In announcing this enforcement action, OFAC stated that it “highlights the sanctions compliance obligations of all individuals and entities that conduct business in OFAC sanctioned jurisdictions or with OFAC-sanctioned parties and that also process transactions directly or indirectly through the United States, or involving U.S. companies, or U.S.-origin goods, services, and technology.”  In 2020, OFAC and DOJ, in resolutions with Essentra FZE Company Limited (“Essentra FZE”) extended this principle to cover the receipt of payments flowing through the U.S. financial system that involved sanctioned jurisdictions. OFAC extended its use of this “causing” theory in two 2021 resolutions, and also settled with four non-U.S. banks for processing payments through the United States that benefited sanctioned jurisdictions or sanctioned persons. 
Union de Banques Arabes et Françaises. On January 4, 2021, OFAC entered into a $8,572,500 settlement with Union de Banques Arabes et Françaises (“UBAF”), a French bank specializing in trade finance, for processing 127 payments on behalf of sanctioned Syrian financial institutions.[55]  The majority of the apparent violations involved UBAF’s processing of internal book-to-book transfers on behalf of Syrian entities (with both Syrian and non-sanctioned entities) that were followed by corresponding funds transfers through the U.S. financial system. The remaining violations were either “back-to-back” letter of credit transactions—where a sanctioned Syrian entity was the beneficiary of export letters of credit or the applicant for import letters of credit that did not involve USD clearing, but the intermediary entered into or received one or more corresponding USD letters of credit to purchase or sell the same goods—or other trade finance transactions involving sanctioned parties, all of which were processed through a U.S. bank. OFAC stated that UBAF’s actions during this time period demonstrated knowledge of OFAC sanctions, but the bank incorrectly believed that avoiding direct USD clearing on behalf of sanctioned parties was sufficient for compliance. OFAC further stated that financial institutions that maintain accounts for entities in jurisdictions that become subject to comprehensive sanctions should assess the risks that may arise in continuing to provide services to those entities, particularly with respect to USD-denominated transactions that directly or indirectly clear through the U.S. financial system. OFAC determined that the apparent violations were non-egregious. This action can be viewed as a follow up case to OFAC’s 2019 enforcement action targeting British Arab Commercial Bank, which also involved indirect USD payments. Read together, these enforcement actions make clear that OFAC is staking out a broad view of the scope of USD transactions that can cause violations of U.S. sanctions law.
BitPay, Inc. On February 18, 2021, OFAC announced a $507,375 settlement with U.S.-based BitPay Inc. (“BitPay”) for apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs.[56]  BitPay is a digital currency payment service provider, which allows merchants to accept digital currency as payment for certain goods and services.  According to OFAC, BitPay allowed persons from Crimea, Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria to transact with merchants on the BitPay platform, despite being in possession of their location information prior to processing the transactions.  While BitPay had a sanctions compliance program designed to prohibit merchants from designated regions from using the platform, it did not screen the location information of the merchants’ buyers. OFAC found BitPay’s failure to exercise due caution or care in discharging its sanctions compliance obligations to be an aggravating factor in calculating the monetary penalty; however, OFAC found the case to be non-egregious, citing as mitigating factors improvements to the company’s compliance program and remedial actions, lack of prior OFAC enforcement history, and cooperation with OFAC.[57]        
Mashreqbank PSC. On November 9, 2021, OFAC issued a Finding of Violation against UAE-based Mashreqbank for its violations of the now-repealed Sudanese Sanctions Regulations.  OFAC found that, because the payment messages Mashreqbank sent to U.S. financial institutions did not include the originating Sudanese bank, the bank’s U.S. correspondents could not interdict the payments, and the payments were therefore successfully processed through the U.S. financial system.  Notably, OFAC decided to issue a no-fine Finding of Violation, as opposed to a civil monetary penalty, in part because Mashreqbank voluntarily entered into a retroactive waiver of OFAC’s five-year statute of limitations, without which OFAC would have been time-barred from charging the violations.  OFAC considered as aggravating factors the high volume and time span of the bank’s prohibited transactions, the bank’s recklessness in employing practices that did not identify sanctioned parties in specific payments, senior employees’ actual knowledge of the illegal conduct and the bank’s deficient internal controls. Meanwhile, OFAC also credited Mashreqbank’s “extensive remediation of its sanctions compliance program,” including significantly increased compliance staffing and spending, closing of all Sudanese accounts, risk-based compliance reforms, mandatory inclusion of originating bank and customer information in payment messages, automated screening, processing USD payments only through the United States, engaging an external consultant to conduct OFAC risk assessment and gap analysis, and upgrading vendor sanctions screening software.  Mashreqbank separately entered into a $100 million consent order with the New York Department of Financial Services (“DFS”).
Bank of China (UK) Limited.  On August 26, 2021, OFAC announced a $2,329,991 civil settlement with Bank of China (UK) Limited (“BOC UK”), a bank located in London, relating to 111 apparent violations of OFAC’s Sudan Sanctions Regulations.[58]  According to OFAC, these 111 transactions occurred over a number of years with a total value of approximately $40,599,184. OFAC stated that the 111 apparent violations related to commercial transactions that BOC UK had caused to be processed through the U.S. financial system on behalf of individuals and entities located in Sudan (which, at the time of the apparent violations, was the target of comprehensive U.S. sanctions), where the transaction documentation available to BOC UK contained a number of references to Sudan.  OFAC determined that the apparent violations were non-egregious and that BOC UK had voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations.  Among the mitigating factors cited by OFAC was that BOC UK undertook a number of remedial measures (including establishing an executive-level committee responsible for the implementation of enhanced compliance policies and procedures and performing annual enterprise-wide sanctions risk assessments by business line) after identifying the apparent violations.
First Bank SA and JC Flowers & Co.  On August 27, 2021, OFAC announced a $862,318 civil settlement with First Bank SA (“First Bank”), a Romanian bank, and its parent company, JC Flowers & Co, relating to 98 apparent violations of the Iran and Syria OFAC sanctions programs.[59]  According to OFAC, these 98 transactions occurred over several years with a total value of approximately $3,589,189.  OFAC stated that the 98 apparent violations related to three categories of payments: (i) processing U.S.D. payments for individuals and entities located in Iran, (ii) processing U.S.D. payments for individuals and entities located in Syria, and (iii) processing euro-denominated payments to Iran as a non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. company.  OFAC found that, based on available transaction documentation, First Bank “had actual knowledge or reason to know it was processing payments on behalf of persons in Iran and Syria.”  OFAC determined that the apparent violations constituted were non-egregious, and that First Bank had voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations to OFAC.  OFAC stated that the violations resulted from “First Bank’s lack of understanding of the scope of U.S. sanctions regulations applicable to financial institutions without a physical presence in the United States.”  OFAC stated that First Bank failed to understand both that (i) it could cause violations of U.S. sanctions by sending payments through the U.S. financial system, and (ii) as an entity majority owned by a U.S. company, it was required to comply with U.S. sanctions targeting Iran.
PT Bukit Muria Jaya.  On January 14, 2021, PT Bukit Muria Jaya (“BMJ”), a paper products manufacturer located in Indonesia, entered into parallel resolutions with DOJ and OFAC.[60]  OFAC settled with BMJ for 28 apparent violations of OFAC’s North Korea sanctions program for $1,016,000, which OFAC deemed satisfied by BMJ’s payment of a greater amount in BMJ’s resolution with DOJ (the DOJ resolution was for conspiracy to commit bank fraud, not sanctions violations).  As in the Essentra FZE matter,[61] BMJ exported cigarette paper to North Korea and a China-based SDN linked to North Korea, and BMJ sales employees replaced references to its North Korean customers on its transactional documents (including invoices, packing lists, and bills of lading) with intermediaries located in third countries.  According to OFAC, BMJ “directed” payments for its North Korean exports to its USD bank account at a non-U.S. bank, which caused U.S. banks to clear wire transfers related to these exports in apparent violation of OFAC’s North Korea regulations.  Despite the numerous parallels to the Essentra FZE action, OFAC found BMJ’s conduct non-egregious, reflecting in part OFAC’s determinations that Essentra willfully violated the NKSR, while BMJ’s conduct was merely reckless.  OFAC stressed in its settlement with BMJ that persons engaged in international trade and commerce should be aware of sanctions prohibitions applicable to non-U.S. persons who involve U.S. persons in such transactions.  As described further below, BMJ also agreed to enter into an eighteen-month deferred prosecution agreement with DOJ for one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and to pay a fine of $1,561,570.[62]
Sojitz (Hong Kong) Limited.  On January 11, 2022, OFAC announced a $5,228,298 settlement with Hong Kong-based Sojitz (Hong Kong) Limited (“Sojitz HK”), an offshore trading and cross-border trade financing company, relating to 60 non-egregious apparent violations of the Iran sanctions program.[63]  According to OFAC, these 60 transactions occurred over a number of years and their total value was approximately $75,603,411.  OFAC stated that these apparent violations related to USD denominated payments made by Sojitz HK for purchases of Iranian-origin high density poly ethylene (“HDPE”) from a Thailand-based supplier for ultimate resale to buyers located in China.  OFAC stated that, as the payment instructions omitted references to Iran, Sojitz HK caused U.S. financial institutions to unknowingly deal in Iran-related transactions.  According to OFAC, these payments were made by certain Sojitz HK employees who were acting contrary to Sojitz HK’s policies despite having been explicitly instructed to not make U.S.D.-denominated payments in connection with Iran-related business transactions.  OFAC viewed Sojitz HK’s termination of these employees and significant enhancement of the company’s sanctions compliance unit and transaction monitoring processes as mitigating factors.
Misunderstanding of OFAC Sanctions or the Scope of OFAC General Licenses.
Often companies misunderstand the applicability or scope of OFAC’s sanctions prohibitions either because they are not aware of sanctions regulations or because they are unaware that such regulations apply to them by virtue of their status as U.S. persons, U.S.-owned subsidiaries (with respect to Cuba and Iran sanctions), or non-U.S. persons engaged in activities with a U.S. nexus (involving U.S. persons, U.S.-origin goods, or U.S. territory, including payments transiting the U.S. financial system).  In addition to the Flowers settlement described above, OFAC entered into the following settlements involving such conduct.
MoneyGram Payment Systems, Inc.  On April 28, 2021, OFAC announced a $34,328 civil settlement with MoneyGram Payment Systems, Inc. (“MoneyGram”), a U.S.-based payments processing company, relating to 359 apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs.[64]  According to OFAC, these 359 transactions occurred over a number of years and their total value was approximately $105,627.  OFAC stated that these apparent violations related to transactions that MoneyGram had processed on behalf of approximately 40 persons on the SDN List who were incarcerated in various federal prisons (MoneyGram provided money transfer services to the U.S.  Bureau of Prisons for several years).  According to OFAC, MoneyGram “erroneously believed that [sanctions] screening of inmates in federal prison was not expected [by the U.S. government].”  OFAC determined the apparent violations were non-egregious, and that MoneyGram had voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations. Among the mitigating factors was that the majority of the transactions would likely have been eligible for a license.  MoneyGram identified the apparent violations as a part of ongoing efforts to improve its sanctions compliance program and took “strong remedial action” to enhance its sanctions screening procedures.
Sanctions Screening Issues; Deficiencies in Automated Processes. 
Many companies screen their customers and other third parties against OFAC’s sanctions lists, but such screening may be deficient due to a failure to adequately calibrate, update, or audit their screening software, lists, and procedures.  A number of recent enforcement actions involved sanctions screening deficiencies, making clear that the utilization of defective screening software or insufficient screening lists will not provide a shield against regulatory enforcement.
Payoneer Inc.  As discussed in our prior memorandum,[65] on July 23, 2021, OFAC announced that it had entered into a $1,400,301 civil settlement with Payoneer Inc. (“Payoneer”), a U.S.-based online money transmitter and provider of prepaid access.[66]  OFAC determined that Payoneer’s sanctions compliance program—in particular, its sanctioned person and location screening procedures—had several deficiencies that had allowed persons located in sanctioned jurisdictions and persons on the SDN List to engage in approximately $802,117 worth of transactions via Payoneer’s services.  According to OFAC, the apparent violations related to commercial transactions processed by Payoneer on behalf of its corporate customers and card-issuing financial institutions.  OFAC determined that the sanctions compliance control breakdowns that led to these apparent violations included: “(i) weak algorithms that allowed close matches to SDN List entries not to be flagged by its filter, (ii) failure to screen for Business Identifier Codes (BICs) even when SDN List entries contained them, (iii) during backlog periods, allowing flagged and pending payments to be automatically released without review, and (iv) lack of focus on sanctioned locations, especially Crimea, because [Payoneer] was not monitoring IP addresses or flagging addresses in sanctioned locations.”  Among the aggravating factors, OFAC noted that Payoneer failed to exercise a minimal degree of caution in carrying out its sanctions compliance obligations and had reason to know the locations of the users subject to sanctions.  OFAC also considered several mitigating factors, including that Payoneer’s senior management self-disclosed some of the apparent violations and implemented remedial measures.  OFAC determined that only a small fraction of the apparent violations were voluntarily disclosed and that the apparent violations were non-egregious.
TD America.  On December 23, 2021 OFAC announced a $115,005 settlement with TD Bank N.A. (“TD Bank”), a U.S.-based financial institution, for two separate matters involving apparent violations of OFAC’s North Korea regulations and the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Sanctions Regulations.  In the first matter, TD Bank processed 1,479 transactions on behalf of employees of the North Korean mission to the United States without a license from OFAC. [67]  According to OFAC, these transactions occurred because TD Bank overly relied on a vendor-supplied politically exposed person screening program that did not include employees of the governments of comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions and because employees of TD Bank input incomplete information about the citizenship information of these customers.  According to OFAC, a significant mitigating factor was that a specific license for all of these transactions likely would have been approved by OFAC.  Separately, OFAC found that TD Bank maintained two accounts for a U.S. resident SDN for over four years.  OFAC stated that the apparent violations with regard to the SDN’s account occurred due to human error and a breakdown in TD Bank’s sanctions compliance procedures, with the SDN’s account being flagged multiple times for a possible SDN match but those flags not being resolved or escalated appropriately, in contravention of the bank’s existing compliance policy.  In both matters, OFAC determined that the violations were non-egregious and voluntarily self-disclosed.
U.S. Parent Liability for Non-U.S. Subsidiary Business with Iran or Cuba.
OFAC is increasingly willing to hold U.S. parent companies liable for Iranian or Cuban business conducted by their non-U.S. subsidiaries.  This trend highlights the importance of performing appropriate due diligence in connection with the acquisition of non-U.S. entities and ensuring that subsidiaries of U.S. companies, and other entities controlled by U.S. persons, understand their obligations to comply with U.S. sanctions on Iran and Cuba, including when they supply goods to other companies within their corporate organization.
Alfa Laval Inc. and Alfa Laval Middle East Ltd.  On July 19, 2021, Alfa Laval Inc. (“AL US”), a U.S.-based company that manufactures and sells storage tank cleaning equipment, agreed to pay OFAC $16,875 to settle apparent violations of Iran sanctions on behalf of its former U.S.-based subsidiary Alfa Laval Tank, Inc. (“AL Tank”).[68]  According to OFAC, the apparent violations occurred between May 2015 and March 2016 when an Iranian company contacted AL Tank to purchase its cleaning units and explicitly stated that the company was based in Iran.  OFAC determined that AL Tank referred the Iranian business opportunity to its Dubai affiliate Alfa Laval Middle East Ltd. (“AL Middle East”). According to OFAC, AL Middle East ordered cleaning units from AL Tank under the false pretense that they were destined for an end-user in the United Arab Emirates. According to OFAC, AL Tank exported the goods to the UAE for delivery to a Dubai-based company, which, in turn, supplied the goods to the Iranian company on behalf of AL Middle East.  Notably, OFAC found that AL Tank failed to heed numerous warning signs that the actual end-user of its products was in Iran, including an email discussing the sale that contained “Iran” in the subject line. OFAC determined that the completed export transaction was worth $18,585.  AL Tank did not voluntarily disclose the apparent violations, which OFAC determined were non egregious.
OFAC separately entered into a $415,695 settlement agreement with AL Middle East for conspiring with Dubai- and Iran-based companies to re-export U.S.-origin storage tank cleaning units to Iran, causing its U.S.-based affiliate to indirectly export goods from the United States to Iran by falsely listing a Dubai-based company as the end-user on export documentation.  OFAC determined that AL Middle East did not voluntarily disclose the apparent violations and that the apparent violations constituted an egregious case.  AL Middle East separately entered into a settlement agreement with BIS regarding related U.S. export control violations.
U.S. Person or U.S.-Origin Goods Involvement in Business with Sanctioned Countries or Sanctioned Persons.
OFAC has regularly pursued enforcement actions against U.S. companies that exported—and non-U.S. companies that purchased—U.S.-origin goods with the intent of re-exporting, transferring, or selling the items to sanctioned persons or jurisdictions.  OFAC has also regularly pursued actions against non-U.S. companies that involved their U.S. affiliates in dealings with sanctioned persons or jurisdictions.  Increasingly, OFAC is focused on services provided by U.S. persons as well as U.S. origin goods. In addition to OFAC’s settlement with AL Middle East, described above, OFAC entered into the following settlements involving such conduct.
Nordgas S.r.l. On March 26, 2021, Nordgas S.r.l. (“Nordgas”), an Italian company that produces and sells components for gas boiler systems and applications, agreed to pay $950,000 to settle apparent violations of the Iran sanctions program.[69] According to OFAC, the apparent violations occurred over an approximately four-year period, during which Nordgas knowingly re-exported 27 shipments of air pressure switches with a total value of approximately $2,526,783 procured from a U.S. company to as many as ten customers in Iran, and therefore caused a U.S. company to indirectly export U.S.-origin goods to Iran.  OFAC determined that Nordgas actively misled the U.S. company by claiming the end-user of the air pressure switches was a Nordgas Italian affiliate.  Additionally, according to OFAC, to conceal their intentions, Nordgas employees used code words and engaged in other efforts to conceal its reexportation of the air pressure switches to Iranian end-users. OFAC noted that Nordgas failed to voluntarily self-disclose the apparent violations, and its willful conduct constituted an egregious case.  OFAC took the rare step of suspending $650,000 of the settlement amount pending Nordgas’s satisfactory completion of compliance commitments; assuming those compliance commitments are met OFAC will presumably waive that portion of the settlement.  OFAC noted that this suspension was warranted due to the individual facts of the case, the company’s financial circumstances, and cooperation with OFAC.
UniControl, Inc.  On March 15, 2021, OFAC announced a $212,464 civil settlement with UniControl, Inc. (“UniControl”), a U.S.-based manufacturer of industrial airflow and boiler controls, for 21 apparent violations of Iran sanctions involving transactions valued at $687,189.[70]  According to OFAC, the apparent violations involved the export of goods from the United States to European customers where UniControl knew or had reason to know the goods were intended specifically for re-export to Iran. OFAC determined that, in two cases, UniControl had actual knowledge that the good were destined for Iran.  According to OFAC, over a four-year period, UniControl failed to take steps to address multiple indications that its European customers intended to supply their goods to Iranian customers, including meetings and events with its European customers that were attended by Iranian companies, the inclusion of Iran on a Sales Representative Agreement, and questions from a customer regarding the ability to supply to Iran.  Additionally, OFAC noted that in 2017 a European customer requested that UniControl remove the “Made in USA” label from its product, citing possible discomfort by Iranian end-users. OFAC noted that at other times some of UniControl’s European customers attempted to evade questions from UniControl regarding the location of their end-users and UniControl did not follow up to clarify.  OFAC determined that the following were mitigating factors: (i) UniControl ceased sales to the European customers at issue and requested the return of two shipments, forfeiting approximately $66,900; (ii) UniControl cooperated with OFAC’s investigation; and (iii) UniControl strengthened its sanctions compliance program, including by requiring customers to sign an end-user certificate and a destination control statement making clear that UniControl products may not be resold.  OFAC determined that UniControl voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations and OFAC determined that the apparent violations were non-egregious.
Alliance Steel, Inc.  On April 19, 2021, OFAC announced a $435,003 civil settlement of 61 apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs with Alliance Steel, Inc. (“Alliance”), a U.S.-based steel structures manufacturer that made sales only to domestic U.S. customers.  OFAC determined that over an approximately five-year period Alliance’s Chief Engineer and Vice President of Engineering engaged with an Iranian engineering company for the importation of Iranian-origin engineering services valued at $1,450,008.  According to OFAC, 12 other senior management employees had actual knowledge of the transactions with and engagement of the Iranian engineering firm, but Alliance claimed that these employees were unfamiliar with U.S. sanctions and OFAC’s regulations because Alliance did not sell any goods or services outside of the United States.  OFAC determined the following to be mitigating factors: (i) Alliance terminated the relationship with the Iranian engineering company and ceased all payments to this company; (ii) Alliance terminated the employee who had initiated and overseen the relationship with the Iranian engineering company; and (iii) Alliance developed and implemented a sanctions and export control compliance policy and provided training to management and employees regarding U.S. sanctions. OFAC determined that Alliance voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations and that the apparent violations, which were non-egregious.
NewTek, Inc. On September 9, 2021, OFAC announced a $189,483 settlement with NewTek, Inc. (“NewTek”), a U.S.-based developer and supplier of live production and 3D animation hardware and software systems, for 52 apparent violations of Iran sanctions.[71]  From approximately December 2013 to May 2018, NewTek authorized the distribution of its products to a reseller in Iran under two distributor agreements. The first agreement was with a company in France and authorized distribution and support of NewTek’s products in the “Middle East” region, which NewTek was informed specifically included Iran.  As for the second agreement, NewTek’s COO was responsible for, and led the negotiations to transfer, the Middle East sales territory from the French company to a new distributor in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.  This agreement similarly authorized the distribution of NewTek products countries in the Middle East sales territory, which explicitly included Iran. OFAC stated that the settlement amount reflected OFAC’s determination that NewTek’s conduct was non-egregious and voluntarily self-disclosed.  OFAC stated that this enforcement action served as a reminder that reliance on informal sanctions compliance measures (according to OFAC, NewTek largely relied on non-U.S. third-party intermediaries to ensure compliance with U.S. sanctions law and did not have its own sanctions compliance policy in place at the time of the apparent violations) may not be sufficient to mitigate sanctions compliance risks.
Schlumberger Rod Lift, Inc.  On September 27, 2021, Schlumberger Rod Lift, Inc. (“SRL”), a U.S.-based company that was formerly a subsidiary of Schlumberger Lift Solutions LLC (“SLS”), which itself is a U.S.-subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited (“Schlumberger”) of Curaçao, Netherlands, entered into a $160,000 settlement with OFAC for an apparent violation involving its facilitation of one shipment of goods from a Schlumberger affiliate in Canada to a Schlumberger joint venture in China, for ultimate delivery to Sudan.[72]  According to OFAC, between December 2015 and April 2016, three U.S. employees who were hired as a part of SLS’s acquisition of another U.S.-based company, facilitated the sale and shipment of oilfield equipment from a Canadian subsidiary of Schlumberger to a Chinese joint venture for onward delivery to Sudan, despite being made aware that the goods were destined for Sudan prior to arranging the shipment.  OFAC noted that the employees confirmed this knowledge in later email communication and that Schlumberger’s internal U.S. sanctions compliance policy at that time prohibited the sale of Schlumberger goods or the provision of services from the United States to Sudan or other comprehensively sanctioned countries (at the time of this shipment, Sudan was the target of comprehensive U.S. sanctions).  According to OFAC, each employee involved had also attended a six-hour training on Schlumberger’s Trade and Customs Compliance program that included a section explaining U.S. person restrictions with respect to activities in connection with sanctioned countries, including the prohibition of facilitation.  OFAC determined that the apparent violations were non-egregious and were not voluntarily self-disclosed.  OFAC noted that this enforcement action highlights the importance of implementing effective compliance programs for multinational corporations operating across multiple global subsidiaries and employing diverse workforces.
Cameron International Corporation. On September 27, 2021, Cameron International Corporation (“Cameron”), a U.S.-based supplier of goods and services to the oil and gas industries, and a subsidiary of Schlumberger, entered into a $1,423,766 settlement with OFAC to resolve apparent violations relating to the provision of services to the Russian energy firm Gazprom-Neft Shelf for an Arctic offshore oil project.[73]  This is OFAC’s first public enforcement action involving apparent violations of Directive 4 of U.S. sectoral sanctions against Russia.  According to OFAC, Cameron provided these services when U.S.-person senior managers at Cameron approved five contracts for its foreign subsidiary, Cameron Romania S.R.L. (“Cameron Romania”), to supply goods to Gazprom-Neft Shelf’s Prirazlomnaya offshore oil production and exploration platform, located in the Russian Arctic. OFAC determined that the approval of these contracts constituted apparent violations of Directive 4, which prohibits, among other things, transactions involving Artic offshore oil exploration with Directive 4 entities. OFAC determined that, because the goods that Cameron supplied were for Gazprom-Neft Shelf’s Prirazlomnaya platform, and because Gazprom-Neft Shelf is a wholly owned subsidiary of OJSC Gazprom Neft (“Gazprom”), which is subject to Directive 4, Gazprom-Neft Shelf is also subject to Directive 4 restrictions by operation of OFAC’s 50 percent rule.  OFAC further determined that Cameron’s approval of the five contracts thus constituted the prohibited provision of services involving a person determined to be subject to Directive 4 (Gazprom-Neft Shelf), its property, or its interests in property.  OFAC also determined that the apparent violations were not voluntarily self-disclosed and that the apparent violations constituted a non-egregious case. In addition to Cameron’s cooperation with OFAC’s investigation, OFAC noted as mitigating factors that Cameron and Schlumberger took “meaningful corrective actions” upon discovering the apparent violations including: (i) identifying all U.S. person employees to be recused from Russia-related activities and incorporating those employees into a recusal acknowledgement system to prevent U.S. persons from participating in Russia-related contracts; (ii) assigning a senior compliance manager to manage the integration of Cameron’s operations into Schlumberger’s compliance program; (iii) implementing an automated block on all Russian “bill to” or “ship to” orders that requires an additional manual review and approval; and (iv) enhancing its end-user management system to add an additional level of scrutiny for Russia-related transactions.
Individual Liability. 
Although OFAC has historically brought enforcement actions against individuals only in rare instances, one such enforcement action was announced in 2021.  On December 8, 2021, OFAC announced a settlement agreement with an unnamed U.S. person, who agreed to pay $133,860 to settle this person’s apparent violations of Iran sanctions.[74]  According to OFAC, during a two-month period in 2016 this U.S. person arranged for and received four payments totaling $133,860 into this individual’s personal bank account on behalf of an Iranian cement company that was managed by a family member related to the purchase of an Iranian-origin clinker, a cement precursor, that the Iranian company supplied to a project in a third country.  OFAC noted that this U.S. person knew or had reason to know that accepting payments on behalf of the Iranian cement company and the facilitation of the export of goods from Iran was prohibited by U.S. sanctions, because this individual had previously applied for an OFAC specific license to authorize other proposed transactions with Iran, and that license request had been denied by OFAC.  Although the facilitation of the payments involved a family member, OFAC determined that these payments were not authorized under the general license OFAC maintains for personal remittances involving Iran, because the transactions at issue were not “noncommercial” as the general license requires.  OFAC also determined that the U.S. person did not voluntarily self-disclose the apparent violations and that the apparent violations were egregious.  The only mitigating factors that OFAC noted were that this U.S. person (i) had not received a penalty notice, finding of violation, or cautionary letter in the five years preceding the earliest transaction at issue, and (ii) had received minimal economic benefit from the transactions and presented evidence regarding financial difficulties affecting this person’s ability to pay.
Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
In addition to its work to implement the AML Act, FinCEN updated its list of jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. FinCEN also initiated its first enforcement action against a crypto futures commission merchant, the latest in a series of regulatory enforcement actions in the cryptocurrency space.
Guidance and Rulemaking
Proposal Rule on Beneficial Ownership Information Reporting. On December 7, 2021, FinCEN issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to implement Section 6403 of the CTA, the first of three formal rulemakings planned by FinCEN to implement the CTA.[75]  FinCEN states that the Proposed Rule is “designed to protect the U.S. financial system from illicit use and impede malign actors from abusing legal entities, like shell companies, to conceal proceeds of corrupt and criminal acts.”[76]  The Proposed Rule outlines, among other things, which entities must report beneficial ownership information (“BOI”), when reports are due, the types of information they must provide to FinCEN, and the penalties for failing to report required information or for willfully reporting false information. Specifically, the Proposed Rule would require covered legal entities (“Reporting Companies”) to provide BOI to FinCEN that identifies two categories of individuals: (1) the beneficial owners of the entity; and (2) individuals who have filed an application with specified governmental or tribal authorities to form the entity or register it to do business. The Proposed Rule would apply to corporations, limited liability companies and other similar entities registered in the United States, as well as non-U.S. companies registered to do business in the United States, but exempts a range of companies from reporting requirements, including: (i) public companies; publicly traded entities, financial institutions, and companies that have 20 or more full-time employees, $5 million in annual revenue and a physical office within the United States. On December 7, 2021, FinCEN issued a proposed rule to implement these provisions.  The comment period closed on February 7, 2022. 
Proposed Rule on Real Estate Sector Reporting Requirements. On December 6, 2021, FinCEN issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit public comment on potential requirements under the BSA for certain individuals involved in non-financed purchases of real estate to collect, report, and retain certain information.  The Proposed Rule aims to “enhance transparency of the domestic real estate market on a nationwide basis and protect the U.S. real estate market from exploitation by criminals and corrupt officials.”[77]  The Proposed Rule reflects the concerns highlighted in the U.S. Government Strategy on Countering Corruption, which highlights money laundering risks posed by anonymous all-cash purchases of U.S. real estate. Currently, Geographic Targeting Orders (“GTOs”) apply to title insurance companies in twelve major U.S. cities, which impose data collections and reporting requirements with respect to real estate transactions.  This Proposed Rule, if enacted, would expand BSA reporting and recordkeeping requirements to new sets of participants in the non-financed real estate market, including real estate developers, managers, lenders, investment advisors, investment companies, brokers and agents, and attorneys, among others. FinCEN is also considering expanding the scope of its regulations to impose additional BSA requirements in the real estate market, specifically on those involved in real estate closings and settlements.  Such an approach would likely involve the application of AML program requirements, including requirements that these entities (i) adopt AML/CFT policies and procedures, (ii) designate a compliance officer, (iii) establish an AML/CFT training program, and (iv) perform independent testing of the program. 
Advisory on FATF-identified Jurisdictions with AML, CTF, and Counter-Proliferation Deficiencies. On February 25, 2021,the Financial Action Task Force (“FATF”) updated its list of jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing.  FATF added Burkina Faso, Cayman Islands, Morocco, and Senegal to the list of “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring” due to lack of effective implementation of their AML/CFT framework and removed the Bahamas from this list. Additionally, FATF determined that Albania, Barbados, Botswana, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, Ghana, Jamaica, Mauritius, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Syria, Uganda, Yemen, and Zimbabwe would remain on the “Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring” list.  FinCEN issued an advisory stating that financial institutions should consider FATF’s statements when reviewing their obligations and risk-based policies, procedures, and practices with respect to these jurisdictions. 
FATF “Gray Lists” Turkey. As discussed in our prior memorandum on November 10, 2021,[78] FATF added Turkey to its list of jurisdictions subject to increased monitoring (also known as the FATF “Gray List”).  With the addition of Turkey (as well as, through separate actions, Jordan and Mali), the FATF Gray List now includes 23 countries that FATF has determined have “strategic deficiencies” in their AML and CFT laws and regulations. FATF President Marcus Pleyer stated that FATF expects Turkey to address “serious issues of supervision” in its banking and real estate sectors as well as precious metals and stones dealers.”[79]  FATF’s concerns regarding Turkey’s commitment to AML/CFT are heightened because of its proximity to Syria, Iraq, and Lebanon, and, in particular, FATF has concerns that terrorists groups may be purchasing real estate in Turkey and otherwise using the Turkish financial sector to launder funds and participate in the global economy.[80]
Report on Assessment of No-Action Letters. On June 28, 2021, FinCEN submitted a report[81] to Congress on its assessment of whether to establish a process for the issuance of no-action letters in response to inquiries concerning the application of BSA and other AML/CFT laws to specific conduct. The report concluded that a no-action letter process would be a useful complement to FinCEN’s current forms of regulatory guidance and relief. In conducting the assessment, FinCEN analyzed various issues, including the timeline and required steps needed for FinCEN to reach a final decision on a no-action letter,  whether improvements in current processes are necessary, and whether a formal no-action process would help to mitigate or accentuate illicit finance risks in the United States. FinCEN concluded that it should plan towards rulemaking to create a process for issuing no-action letters, with the timing subject to resource limitations and competing priorities.[82] 
AML/CFT National Priorities. On June 30, 2021, FinCEN, after consulting with the Treasury’s Offices of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, OFAC, the Attorney General, Federal functional regulators, relevant State financial regulators and relevant national security agencies, issued the first government-wide priorities for AML/CFT policies. The priorities are: (1) corruption; (2) cybercrime, including relevant cybersecurity and virtual currency considerations; (3) foreign and domestic terrorist financing; (4) fraud; (5) transnational criminal organization activity; (6) drug trafficking organization activity; (7) human trafficking and human smuggling; and (8) proliferation financing. The establishment of these priorities is intended to assist all covered institutions in their efforts to meet their obligations under laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering and counter terrorist financing.[83]  Banks are not required to incorporate the AML/CFT Priorities into their risk-based BSA compliance programs until the effective date of the final revised regulations; nevertheless, they should start preparing for any new requirements when the final rules are published. In addition, examiners from the federal banking agencies and state financial regulators will not examine banks for the incorporation of the AML/CFT Priorities into their risk-based BSA programs until the effective date of the final revised regulations.
Solicitation of Comments on AML Rules in the Antiquities Market. On September 23, 2021, FinCEN issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM)[84] to solicit comment on questions related to the implementation of AML rules in the antiquities market. Section 6110 of the AML Act[85] expands the list of “financial institutions” under the BSA to include antiquities dealers, specifically “a person engaged in the trade of antiquities, including an advisor, consultant or any other person who engages as a business in the solicitation or the sale of antiquities, subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary” and requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue proposed rules to carry out the amendment. FinCEN’s principal questions are: (i) how “antiquities” should be defined and whether jurisdictional considerations should be taken into account in the definition; (ii) the roles of persons engaged in antiquities trade, including advisors, consultants, dealers, agents, and intermediaries; (iii) how transactions related to trade in antiquities are typically financed and facilitated; (iv) whether FinCEN should establish a monetary threshold for regulating activities in antiquities trade; and (v) the difficulties associated with requiring disclosures of or otherwise obtaining beneficial ownership information for legal entities engaged in the antiquities trade, including foreign legal entities that may be outside the scope of current or future U.S. beneficial ownership reporting requirements. The comment period closed on October 25, 2021. 
Notice on Environmental Crimes and Illicit Financial Activity. On November 18, 2021, FinCEN issued an environmental crimes and associated illicit financial activity notice, “to call attention to an upward trend in environmental crimes and associated illicit financial activity” and to provide financial institutions with specific SAR filing instructions.[86]  The notice states that environmental crimes and related illicit financial activity are associated strongly with corruption and transnational criminal organizations, both of which have been identified as AML/CFT priorities. The notice includes an appendix that describes five categories of environmental crimes: wildlife trafficking, illegal logging, illegal fishing, illegal mining, and waste and hazardous substances trafficking. The notice acknowledges the historical problems with enforcement in this area as these crimes often involve transnational activity and therefore benefit from a lack of solid international cooperation between law enforcement agencies and regulators. 
Proposed Regulation on Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Convertible Virtual Currency and Digital Asset Transactions. As described in a separate memorandum, on December 18, 2020, FinCEN proposed a regulation that would extend BSA reporting requirements on financial institutions to include convertible virtual currency (“CVC”) and legal tender digital assets (“LTDA”) transactions exceeding $10,000 in value, as well as extending existing BSA recordkeeping requirements to include CVC transactions greater than $3,000 when a counterparty uses an unhosted or otherwise covered wallet.[87]  The proposed rule defines “otherwise covered” wallets as those held at a financial institution that is not subject to the BSA or is located in a foreign jurisdiction identified by FinCEN as a jurisdiction of primary money-laundering concern, including Burma, Iran, and North Korea.[88]  After significant pushback to the limited comment period (which was initially set for an abridged 15-day period), on January 15, 2021, FinCEN reopened the comment period for (i) an additional 15 days on the proposed reporting requirements regarding information on CVC or LTDA transactions greater than $10,000, or aggregating to greater than $10,000, that involve unhosted wallets or wallets hosted in jurisdictions identified by FinCEN; and (ii) an additional 45 days for comments on the proposed requirements that banks and MSBs report certain information regarding counterparties to transactions by their hosted wallet customers and on the proposed recordkeeping requirements.[89]  Pursuant to the Biden Administration’s regulatory freeze order issued on January 20,[90] FinCEN published a notice of extension on January 26 that extended the reopened comment period to allow an additional 60 days to respond to all aspects of the proposed rule.[91]  On May 27, 2021, Acting Director Michael Mosier said in an interview that the rule was still under review.[92]
Proposed Amendments to the Recordkeeping Rule and Travel Rule. As discussed in our prior memoranda, on October 27, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board and FinCEN issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking[93] that would amend the recordkeeping rule (“Recordkeeping Rule”) and travel rule (“Travel Rule”) regulations issued under the BSA.[94]  The Recordkeeping Rule requires financial institutions to collect and retain the following information related to funds transfers and transmittals of funds in amounts of $3,000 or more: (i) the name and address of originator/transmitter; (ii) the amount of the payment or transmittal order; (iii) the execution date of the payment or transmittal order; (iv) any payment instructions received from the originator or transmitter with the payment or transmittal order; and (v) the identity of the beneficiary's bank or recipient's financial institution.[95]  The Travel Rule requires banks and nonbank financial institutions to transmit information on certain funds transfers and transmittals of funds to other banks or nonbank financial institutions participating in the transfer or transmittal.[96]
The proposed rule[97] lowers the applicable threshold from $3,000 to $250 for transactions that begin or end outside the United States, as smaller-value wire transfers are being used to facilitate criminal activity, and the effect on financial institutions tasked with collecting this information is estimated to be low. The proposed rule also clarifies the meaning of “money” as used in certain defined terms to make clear that the Recordkeeping and Travel Rules apply to transactions above the applicable threshold involving convertible virtual currencies or any digital assets with legal tender status.
The proposed rule remains pending.
Enforcement Actions
Capital One. As discussed in our prior memorandum, on January 15, 2021, FinCEN announced that Capital One had agreed to pay a $390 million civil money penalty for engaging in both willful and negligent violations of the BSA and its implementing regulations.[98]  An earlier $100 million penalty paid to the OCC was credited against this FinCEN penalty. FinCEN found that the bank failed to file thousands of SARs and CTRs between 2008 and 2014 in connection with its Check Cashing Group, which the bank established in 2008 after acquiring several other regional banks.[99]  Capital One provided banking services to between 90 and 150 check casher customers within the group, including providing armored car cash shipments and check processing. FinCEN found that the bank failed to make required filings despite being aware of several compliance and money laundering risks associated with banking this particular group, including warnings from regulators, customers with criminal charges, and internal assessments that indicated the customers of that group were among the bank’s most at risk for money laundering.[100] In some cases, the bank failed to file SARs even when it had actual knowledge of criminal charges against specific customers, including a convicted associate of the Genovese organized crime family, relating to its check-cashing activities and potential money laundering.[101]
In determining the penalty, FinCEN considered Capital One’s significant remediation and cooperation with FinCEN’s investigation. In particular, Capital One exited the Check Cashing Group in 2014, took specific remedial efforts related to its SAR and CTR filing systems, and made significant investments and improvements in its BSA/AML program.
BitMEX. As discussed in our prior memorandum,[102] FinCEN and the CFTC levied a $100 million civil money penalty against BitMEX, a non-U.S. crypto derivatives exchange, for violations of the BSA and the Currency Exchange Act (CEA). BitMEX, which is domiciled in the Seychelles, runs a crypto exchange that allows users to trade in cryptocurrency derivatives, including derivatives on bitcoin, ether, and litecoin. FinCEN found that BitMEX willfully (i) failed to implement and maintain a compliant AML program, (ii) failed to implement and maintain a compliant CIP and (iii) failed to report certain suspicious activity. Specifically, BitMEX allowed customers to access its platform and conduct derivatives trading without performing appropriate CDD. Although BitMEX publicly represented that its platform was not conducting business with U.S. persons, FinCEN found that BitMEX solicited and accepted orders from U.S. persons and failed to implement appropriate internal controls to screen customers who used a virtual private networks (“VPN”) from accessing the trading platform. FinCEN noted instances where BitMEX senior leadership altered U.S. customer information in order to hide a customer’s true location. The significant $100 million fine reflects the “extensive scope and grave seriousness of the violations,” including FinCEN’s assessment of the possible harm to the public and amounts involved; $80 million in payments will go to FinCEN and the CFTC now, with an additional $20 million penalty suspended pending completion of a SAR lookback and independent consultant reviews of BitMEX’s AML policies, procedures and controls.[103]  Additionally, BitMEX was required to hire a qualified independent consultant to (i) conduct a lookback on all transactions by, at or through the BitMEX platform from November 2013 through December 2020, and (ii) to perform two reviews of BitMEX’s operations, policies, procedures and controls to confirm that they are effective and reasonably designed to ensure that BitMEX is not operating in the United States or conducting business directly or indirectly with U.S. customers. 
The CFTC’s August 2021 Consent Order with BitMEX, which resolved its lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (“SDNY”),[104] found that from at least November 2014 through October 2020, BitMEX violated the CEA by (i) operating a facility to trade or process swaps without regulatory approval and (ii) operating as an FCM without CFTC registration. The CFTC also found that BitMEX violated CFTC regulations by failing to implement (i) procedures that would enable BitMEX to identify U.S. customers utilizing its platform and (ii) an AML program.[105] The CFTC Consent Order notes that BitMEX had engaged in remedial measures, including the development of an AML and user verification program, and has further certified that anyone located in the United States is prohibited from accessing the BitMEX platform and all U.S. users have been blocked from trading or utilizing the BitMEX platform. BitMEX also confirmed that it no longer maintains significant business operations or functions in the U.S.[106]  Concurrent with the filing of the CFTC complaint, the S.D.N.Y. U.S. Attorney’s Office indicted BitMEX founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, and BitMEX executive Gregory Dwyer on charges of violating the BSA and conspiracy to violate the BSA.[107]  That case is still pending.
CommunityBank of Texas. On December 16, 2021, FinCEN announced an $8 million civil money penalty and consent order against CommunityBank of Texas (“CBOT”).[108]  CBOT is a community bank with approximately $4 billion in assets. FinCEN found that CBOT willfully (i) “failed to implement and maintain an effective AML program,” and (ii) “failed to report hundreds of suspicious transactions to FinCEN involving illegal financial activity by its customers” even after CBOT “was aware that certain customers were subjects of criminal investigations.”[109]  FinCEN stated that these unreported transactions totaled millions of dollars and included “transactions connected to tax evasion, illegal gambling, money laundering and other financial crimes.”[110]  The Consent Order identified several deficiencies in CBOT’s AML program, including that CBOT’s AML Department was severely understaffed, which exacerbated the other BSA/AML deficiencies FinCEN identified during the examinations.[111]  FinCEN also identified poor management of the customer due diligence (“CDD”) program and inadequate transaction monitoring and suspicious activity alert clearing. The Consent Order stated that CBOT had relied too heavily on its automated monitoring system and did not sufficiently ensure that the system was meeting expectations.[112]  Additionally, FinCEN found that CBOT had “willfully” failed to file at least 17 SARs during the review period. The Consent Order provided examples of customers who were engaged in significant illegal activity and for whom the bank missed repeated red flags either at account opening, through ongoing monitoring, or both.[113]   A separate penalty of $1 million was assessed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), but because the facts and circumstances underlying each penalty were the same, FinCEN credited this amount when assessing its own penalty, leaving the total penalty at $8 million.[114] 
Department of Justice
Last year, the DOJ did not bring large enforcement actions related to AML or sanctions. There were, however, multiple AML, money laundering, or sanctions-related criminal charges against individuals in the cryptocurrency space.
Criminal Prosecutions
Money Laundering Guilty Plea of Bitcoin “Mixer.” On August 18, 2021, the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s office announced that Larry Dean Harmon, the founder of U.S.-based cryptocurrency mixing service, Helix, pleaded guilty to a money laundering conspiracy.[115]  As discussed in our prior memorandum,[116] Harmon, through Helix, offered virtual currency “mixer” services, which allowed customers to pay a fee to send virtual currency to a designated address in a manner designed to conceal and obfuscate the source or owner. In connection with the guilty plea, Helix admitted that it partnered with several Darknet markets, including AlphaPay, a Darknet market well-known for the purchase and sale of illegal drugs, guns, and other illegal goods.[117]  Harmon admitted to exchanging approximately 354,468 bitcoin, with a market value of approximately $311,145,854 at the time, through Helix.[118] On October 19, 2020, he was fined $60 million by FinCEN for violating the BSA’s registration, program, and reporting requirements by failing to register as a money services business, failing to implement and maintain an effective AML program, and failing to report suspicious activities.
DOJ Indicts Another Bitcoin “Mixer.”  On April 28, 2021, the DOJ announced that Roman Sterlingov, operator of Bitcoin Fog, was arrested on criminal charges related to his operation of a bitcoin money-laundering service on the Darknet.[119]  DOJ alleged that Sterlingov operated Bitcoin Fog, the longest-running cryptocurrency “mixer,” since 2011. DOJ further alleged that over the course of its operations, Bitcoin Fog transferred over 1.2 billion bitcoin, with a market value of approximately $335 billion at the time of the transactions. Sterlingov is facing the same charges Harmon did, namely, money laundering, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, and money transmission without a license.[120]
Virgil Griffith Guilty Plea. Virgil Griffith, a U.S. citizen and developer of the cryptocurrency, Ether, traveled to North Korea in 2019 to attend and present at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference. After being arrested and indicted in 2019 for alleged violations of the IEEPA in connection with that presentation, Griffith filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing in part that the presentation fell under the informational exemption under the Berman Amendment and the Free Trade in Ideas Act, emphasizing that information in the public domain is generally exempt from IEEPA restrictions. On January 27, 2021, the court denied Griffith’s motion, finding that OFAC’s interpretation of the informational exception was permissible and leaving the application of the informational exemption to the jury. On September 27, 2021, Griffith pleaded guilty to conspiring to assist North Korea in evading sanctions, and is awaiting sentencing.[121]  According to the guilty plea, while in North Korea, Griffin spoke about how North Korea could launder money and evade sanctions by leveraging blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and thereafter, facilitated the exchange of cryptocurrency between North Korea and South Korea.[122]   
Federal Banking Agencies
BSA/AML and sanctions compliance continue to be important areas of focus for the federal banking agencies. In addition to guidance offered by some of the agencies, although enforcement actions were down compared to prior years.
Guidance and Rulemaking
Joint Statement on BSA/AML Compliance. On April 9, 2021, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), FinCEN, National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), and OCC, issued a joint statement addressing how risk management principles described in the “Supervisory Guidance on Model Risk Management” (referred to as the “model risk management guidance” or MRMG) relate to systems or models used by banks to assist in complying with the requirements of the BSA rules and regulations. [123]  The statement was meant to clarify how the MRMG may be used as a resource to guide a bank’s model risk management framework, noting that whether a bank characterizes a certain BSA/AML system (or parts of that system) as a model, tool or an application, risk management of this system should be “consistent with safety and soundness principles” and should “promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations.”[124]  The statement is meant to clarify how the MRMG may be used to guide a bank’s model risk management framework.”[125]  The statement notes that the MRMG provides flexibility for banks as they develop, implement and update their own models, and that banks may use the principles discussed in the MRMG to establish, implement and maintain their own risk management framework. The agencies emphasized that the statement does not alter any existing BSA/AML legal or regulatory requirements, nor does it establish any new supervisory expectations.[126]  
Enforcement Actions
Mashreqbank PSC. On November 9, 2021, the Federal Reserve Board issued a consent order against Mashreqbank and its New York Branch for engaging in transactions in violation of OFAC sanctions and for “lack[ing] adequate risk management supervision and oversight of its branches to ensure compliance with applicable OFAC Regulations.”[127] The Fed did not impose a monetary penalty but required that Mashreqbank, among other things,: (i) submit an acceptable OFAC Compliance Program applicable to the bank’s global business lines; (ii) engage an independent external party to conduct annual OFAC Compliance Reviews; and (iii) complete a global OFAC risk assessment with particular attention to transactions involving group affiliates, branches, and subsidiaries.[128]
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
Guidance and Rulemaking
Risk Alert on BSA Requirements. On March 29, 2021 the SEC’s Division of Examinations released a Risk Alert to remind broker-dealers of their obligations under AML rules and regulations, in particular the need to monitor for and report suspicious activity to law enforcement and financial regulators.[129]  The Risk Alert, which encouraged broker-dealers to review and improve their AML policies, procedures, and controls related to the monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity, signals that the SEC will remain focused on AML issues. The SEC’s 2021 Exam Priorities also noted that the SEC “will continue to prioritize examinations of broker-dealers and registered investment companies for compliance with their AML obligations, in order to assess, among other things, whether firms have established appropriate customer identification programs and whether they are satisfying their SAR filing obligations, conducting due diligence on customers, complying with beneficial ownership requirements, and conducing robust and timely independent tests of their AML programs.”[130] 
Enforcement Actions
Alpine Securities Corp. v. SEC. On November 8, 2021, the Supreme Court declined a petition for certiorari from brokerage firm Alpine Securities Corp. (“Alpine”) in connection with SEC charges that Alpine violated SAR filing requirements under the BSA.[131]  As described in our prior publication,[132] the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had affirmed the district court’s judgment, holding that (i) the SEC has the authority to enforce Section 17(a) of the Exchange Act through this civil action; (ii) Rule 17a-8, which requires compliance with BSA requirements, is a reasonable interpretation of Section 17(a); (iii) Rule 17a-8 does not violate the Administrative Procedure Act; (iv) the district court did not err in granting summary judgment with respect to SAR violations; and (v) in imposing a civil penalty against Alpine, the district court did not abuse its discretion.[133]  With the Supreme Court’s denial of review, this much-watched challenge to the SEC’s authority to enforce the BSA has concluded. 
GWFS Equities. On May 12, 2021, the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order and a $1.5 million penalty against broker-dealer GWFS Equities, Inc. for violating the BSA by failing to file SARs and submitting deficient SARs filings. The SEC found that GWFS failed to file 130 SARs and that when GWFS did file SARs, at least 297 of them were deficient because they omitted the “five essential elements”—Who? What? When? Where? Why?—of SAR narratives. The SEC’s order acknowledges that GWFS undertook significant remedial measures that impacted the resolution, including (i) implementing new SAR drafting procedures, (ii) increasing the size and experience of its AML compliance team, and (iii) restructuring its SAR process to ensure greater quality control.
Robinhood Financial LLC. On June 30, 2021, Robinhood reached a settlement with FINRA, which included $57 million in fines and approximately $12.6 million in restitution. FINRA alleged, among other things, that between 2016 and 2018, Robinhood failed to establish and implement a reasonably designed CIP. Specifically, Robinhood approved more than $5.5 million new customer account by relying on a CIP that was largely automated and suffered from multiple flaws. Before May 2017, for example, Robinhood automatically approved accounts flagged as needing further review because of fraud indicators. (The settlement covered various other allegations, including providing false and misleading information to customers.) 
LPL Financial. On October 1, 2021, the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order against broker-dealer LPL Financial, pursuant to which LPL Financial will pay restitution of more than $4.1 million to Mayagüez (P.R.) Economic Development Inc. (“MEDI”), the Puerto Rican government entity defrauded by investment advisor Eugenio Garcia Jimenez Jr. (“Garcia”) and pay a $750,000 civil penalty to settle SEC charges related to LPL Financial’s deficient AML policies and procedures. As alleged in the SEC’s December 1, 2020 civil complaint against Garcia in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico,[134] the Municipio Autónimo de Mayagüez, Puerto Rico hired Garcia to provide investment advice and carry out a strategy to invest $9 million of municipal funds. Garcia, acting as an unregistered advisor, misappropriated $ 4.1 million of the city’s funds through an account at an unnamed brokerage firm, and another $3.1 million through an investment account Garcia subsequently opened at LPL Financial. The SEC found that LPL Financial failed to follow its CIP procedures and allowed Garcia to open an account at LPL Financial despite the fact that various employees at LPL Financial questioned the account’s beneficial ownership, source of funds, and reason for transferring the misappropriated funds from the unnamed brokerage firm to Garcia’s account at LPL Financial. Less than a month after opening the account, LPL Financial decided to exit its relationship with Garcia and MEDI after flagging several suspicious transactions. LPL Financial received a reduced monetary penalty conditioned on significant remedial measures, including modification of its policies and procedures, increasing its staffing, and enhancements to its fraud surveillance program, centralized surveillance and investigations functions, enhanced consistency of AML escalations and reporting, and enhanced quality control testing for transaction monitoring and customer due diligence. 
Wedbush Securities Inc. On December 15, 2021, the SEC issued a cease-and-desist order and a $1.2 million penalty against broker-dealer Wedbush Securities, Inc., to settle charges arising from the unlawful, unregistered distribution of almost 100 million shares from more than 50 different low-priced microcap companies and from Wedbush’s failure to file SARs pertaining to those transactions.[135]  In addition to violations related to the sale of unregistered securities, the SEC found that Wedbush ignored numerous red flags and failed to file SARs for certain suspicious transactions it executed on behalf of Silverton SA (a/k/a Wintercap SA), a former offshore customer who engaged in unlawful distribution of securities. The SEC order notes that Silverton falsely certified to Wedbush that it was the beneficial owner of the securities and sold stock on behalf of control persons by depositing stock in accounts held in Silverton’s name held at multiple brokers, including Wedbush, and then selling those shares to the public. The SEC also found that Wedbush failed to follow its own policies and procedures, which acknowledged a heightened risk of illegal unregistered offerings associated with the sale of low-priced securities in general, and set forth guidance for identifying suspicious activity associated with sales of low-priced securities. In addition to payment of the $1 million civil penalty and $207,000 in prejudgment interest, Wedbush is required to engage an independent compliance consultant to undertake a “broad review” of Wedbush’s supervisory, compliance and other policies and procedures.
New York Department of Financial Services
Under new Superintendent Adrienne Harris, the DFS continued to pursue AML and sanctions investigations, but within a broader investigative agenda that included opioids, cybersecurity, insurance fraud, consumer protection, and addressing risks related to cryptocurrency and emerging financial technology. In 2021, DFS announced just one large bank penalty relating to sanctions compliance. 
Mashreqbank PSC. As discussed in our prior memorandum and above, on November 9, 2021, DFS entered into a $100 million consent order with UAE-based Mashreqbank, PSC and its New York Branch for OFAC compliance deficiencies that resulted in violations of the now-repealed Sudan-related sanctions.[136]  The Fed and OFAC entered into concurrent resolutions with the bank, but this is the first multi-agency sanctions resolution where the monetary penalty was entirely imposed by DFS. DFS found that, despite being aware of longstanding Sudanese sanctions, from 2005 to 2009 the bank structured Sudan-related payments to avoid detection of the Sudanese component by U.S.-based banks. Specifically, the DFS found that, despite the bank’s policies prohibiting the use of U.S. correspondent accounts to process Sudan-related payments without an OFAC license, the bank nevertheless used cover payments to process over 1,700 U.S.D.-denominated funds transfers (totaling over $4 billion) for Sudanese entities through its New York Branch and other U.S. financial institutions.[137]  The DFS additionally found that, between 2010 and 2014, the New York Branch processed another $2.5 million of prohibited payments involving less obvious ties to Sudan (for example, a number of these customers were not resident or domiciled in Sudan, and the payment instructions did not reference Sudan), despite the Bank’s notice that its prior Sudanese-related transactions were problematic. [138]  The DFS also found that longstanding deficiencies in the bank and the New York Branch’s OFAC compliance policies and procedures facilitated the prohibited transactions. The DFS also faulted Mashreqbank for its failure to report its Sudan-related transactions when it decided to close all the U.S.D. accounts held by Sudanese banks upon learning that the Swiss bank that processed those transactions for Mashreqbank was being investigated by the New York District Attorney for sanctions violations. The DFS previously fined Mashreqbank $40 million in 2018 for violations of the BSA in connection with the New York Branch’s U.S.D. clearing operations.[139] 
Additional Developments
Commerce Department Regulatory Actions Focused on the Risks of Certain Non-U.S. Technologies and Non-U.S. Malicious Cyber Actors
In 2021 the Biden Administration maintained and implemented several executive orders and Commerce Department rules or proposed rules issued during the Trump Administration that focus on the risks of certain non-U.S. technologies or non-U.S. malicious cyber actors accessing U.S. technologies or sensitive personal data. These actions focus on two main areas of risk that the U.S. government has identified with respect to certain listed “foreign adversary” jurisdictions, which, most notably, include China and Russia. The first area of risk relates to the potential for “undue” or “unacceptable” risks arising from U.S. persons’ use of ICTS that are designed, developed, manufactured, or otherwise created by companies that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary. The second area relates to the potential for foreign adversary malicious cyber actors to either use U.S. infrastructure as a service (“IaaS”) products to engage in malicious cyber activities or to access sensitive personal data regarding U.S. persons. 
Below, we survey several notable actions taken by the Biden Administration in these areas in 2021:
Executive Order on Protecting Americans’ Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries. On June 9, 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14304, entitled “Executive Order on Protecting Americans’ Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries.”  This order revoked Executive Orders 13942 and 13943, which had been issued by President Trump in 2020 and which directed the Department of Commerce to issue certain prohibitions relating to the TikTok and WeChat mobile apps (commonly known as the TikTok and WeChat “bans”).[140]  These bans did not go into effect due to litigation. On September 21, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against the implementation of the WeChat order on First Amendment grounds, and on December 7, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia similarly granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against the implementation of the TikTok executive order based on a finding that the order exceeded the President’s authority under IEEPA.[141]  Because of President Biden’s order, both of these cases have now been resolved.[142]
In addition to revoking the TikTok and WeChat “bans,” President Biden’s order institutes a new framework for determining the national security risks posed by mobile apps that are connected to the governments or militaries of foreign adversaries (referred to in the order as “connected software applications”). The order directs the Commerce Department, working in conjunction with other federal agencies, to (i) assess the threats posed by connected software applications controlled by foreign adversaries, (ii) provide recommendations on how to protect U.S. persons’ sensitive personal data, and (iii) evaluate transactions involving connected software applications that pose risks to U.S. national security. 
More specifically, the order directs the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other agencies, to conduct an evaluation and ultimately present a report to the National Security Advisor with recommendations to “protect against harm from the unrestricted sale of, transfer of, or access to” U.S. persons’ sensitive data, including (i) personally identifiable information, (ii) personal health information, and (iii) genetic information as well as “access to large data repositories” by “foreign adversaries.”  Unlike the report, discussed below, regarding connected software applications, this report is not focused on software or apps, but rather is more broadly focused on “foreign adversary” access to these types of U.S. personal information including those found in “data repositories.”  Such “data repositories” could potentially include, among other things, the U.S. data broker industry.
The order also directs the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other agencies, to conduct an separate evaluation of the risks posed by connected software applications and provide a report to the National Security Advisor and the Assistant to the President recommending additional executive and legislative actions to address such risks.[143]
The order further directs the Secretary of Commerce to evaluate transactions involving connected software applications that may pose risks to the national security, information and communications technology, critical infrastructure, or the digital economy of the United States and to take appropriate action in accordance with the ICTS executive order and implementing regulations (discussed further below).
Information and Communications Technology and Services Executive Order and Implementing Regulations. On May 15, 2019, President Trump issued Executive Order 13873 entitled “Securing the Information and Communications Technology and Services Supply Chain” (the “ICTS Order”).[144]  The ICTS Order declared a national emergency under IEEPA regarding the threat posed by “foreign adversaries” creating and exploiting vulnerabilities in ICTS. The ICTS Order also required the Secretary of Commerce to issue implementing regulations prohibiting U.S. transactions involving ICTS from a “foreign adversary” jurisdiction.
In the final days of the Trump Administration, on January 14, 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) announced that it had issued an interim final rule (the “ICTS Rule”) to implement the ICTS Order. Commerce had previously issued a proposed rule to implement the ICTS Order in late 2019, but ultimately withdrew the proposed rule after significant comments from U.S. industry stakeholders. The ICTS Rule empowers Commerce to review and regulate a range of technology products and services transactions involving U.S. companies and ICTS designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by Chinese companies, among others.
As discussed in our prior memorandum,[145] the ICTS Rule gives Commerce broad authority to review—and to prohibit or impose mitigation on—a wide of range of transactions involving ICTS products and services (which themselves are also broadly defined in the ICTS Rule to include a variety of hardware, software, apps, internet hosting services, and cloud-based computing services, as well as products and services related to local area networks, mobile networks, and core networking systems). The ICTS Rule applies to U.S. transactions involving ICTS products and services that are designed, developed, manufactured, or otherwise created by companies that are subject to the jurisdiction of six designated foreign adversaries: China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and the Maduro regime in Venezuela.
Under the review framework, the ICTS Rule provides the Secretary of Commerce with several criteria to  perform an initial review of the covered ICTS transaction to assess whether the transaction poses an “undue” or “unacceptable” risk. If the Secretary’s initial determination is that the covered ICTS transaction presents “undue” or “unacceptable” risks, then the Secretary must explain in writing why the transaction presents such risks, and either prohibit the transaction or propose mitigation measures under which the transaction may be permitted. A party to a covered ICTS transaction has 30 days from the service date of this initial determination to provide a written response. After receipt of a party’s response, the Secretary must consider the response and engage with other relevant government agencies prior to issuing a final determination published in the Federal Register. 
After much speculation as to whether the Biden Administration would continue the Trump Administration’s tough stance on China and its technology sector, the ICTS Rule went into effect with no adjustments on March 22, 2021.[146]  Days before the ICTS Rule took effect, Secretary of Commerce Gina M. Raimondo also announced that Commerce had served subpoenas on multiple Chinese companies that provide ICTS in the United States pursuant to Executive Order 13873.[147]  While Commerce declined to say which companies it subpoenaed, this action confirms that the Biden Administration has moved forward with implementing the Rule and reviewing covered ICTS transactions that the U.S. government views as potentially posing a threat to national security. 
On November 21, 2021, Commerce issued a proposed rule to amend the ICTS Rule.[148]  Specifically, the proposed rule revises the definition of ICTS to expressly include “connected software applications,” which means “software, a software program, or a group of software programs, that is designed to be used on an end-point computing device and includes as an integral functionality, the ability to collect, process, or transmit data via the internet.”  The proposal would also amend the ICTS Rule by providing additional criteria—first identified in President Biden’s June 9, 2021 Executive Order On Protecting Americans’ Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries—that Commerce may consider in determining whether certain transactions involving “connected software applications” present an undue or unacceptable risk:

Ownership, control, or management by persons that support a foreign adversary’s military, intelligence, or proliferation activities;
Use of the connected software application to conduct surveillance that enables espionage, including through a foreign adversary’s access to sensitive or confidential government or business information, or sensitive personal data;
Ownership, control, or management of connected software applications by persons subject to coercion or cooption by a foreign adversary;
Ownership, control, or management of connected software applications by persons involved in malicious cyber activities;
A lack of thorough and reliable third-party auditing of connected software applications;
The scope and sensitivity of the data collected;
The number and sensitivity of the users of the connected software application; and
The extent to which identified risks have been or can be addressed by independently verifiable measures.

Notably, these criteria would complement, and are in addition to, the criteria already in 15 C.F.R. § 7.103(c) for determining whether an ICTS transaction poses an undue or unacceptable risk.
Commerce asked for public comment on the additional criteria for connected software applications, including, among other things, (i) how the criteria should be applied to ICTS transactions involving connected software applications; (ii) whether the criteria should be applied to just ICTS transactions involving connected software applications or all transactions; (iii) whether the phrase “ownership, control or management,”  should it be understood to include both continuous control and sporadic control (e.g., when a third party must be temporally granted access to apply updates, upgrades, or patches). This public comment period closed on January 11, 2022. Commerce has not yet issued a final rule amending the ICTS Rule.
Infrastructure as a Service Executive Order and Rulemaking. On January 19, 2021, President Trump issued an executive order titled “Taking Additional Steps to Address the National Emergency with Respect to Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities” (the “IaaS Order”) that, among other things, directed the Secretary of Commerce to implement regulations to deter “foreign malicious cyber actors’” use of U.S. IaaS.[149] Specifically, the IaaS Order directed the Commerce to (i) issue know-your-customer-like identity verification and recordkeeping requirements for U.S. IaaS providers that engage in transactions with non-U.S. persons and (ii) consult with other U.S. government agencies to impose restrictions (termed “special measures”) on non-U.S. jurisdictions and persons that are determined to be using U.S. IaaS to engage in malicious cyber activities. The IaaS Order defined IaaS as meaning “any product or service offered to a consumer, including complimentary or ‘trial’ offerings, that provides processing, storage, networks, or other fundamental computing resources, and with which the consumer is able to deploy and run software that is not predefined, including operating systems and applications.”
On September 24, 2021, Commerce published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (“ANPRM”) that solicited the public’s comments on “all aspects of how [Commerce] should implement” the IaaS Order. In particular, the ANPRM solicited comments on (i) the scope of any potential customer due diligence regulations, (ii) “special measures,” including the potential for limiting accounts for persons located in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions as a blanket rule, (iii) definitions of terms to be used in any potential regulations, and (iv) broad “overarching inquiries” regarding what the IaaS Order seeks to regulate, including whether Commerce should look to regulatory frameworks in other industries to inform its approach with respect to implementing the IaaS Order. The comment period for the ANPRM closed on October 25, 2021 and, to date, Commerce has not published proposed IaaS regulations or taken further public actions to implement the IaaS Order.
Considerations for Strengthening Sanctions/AML Compliance
In light of the developments described above, senior management, general counsel, and compliance officers may wish to consider the follow points in strengthening their institutions’ sanctions/AML compliance programs:

Continued Caution Around U.S.D. Transactions. The BMJ and Sojitz enforcement actions serve as an important reminder that virtually any U.S. nexus to transactions can trigger a criminal or civil sanctions enforcement action. These actions, as well as the 2020 Essentra FZE resolution, targeted non-U.S., non-financial institutions engaged in transactions involving ordinary goods and services and sanctioned jurisdictions, with the only apparent U.S. nexus being the use of the U.S. financial system. Until recently, such conduct was generally not seen as warranting criminal enforcement. It is also notable that Essentra FZE and BMJ were targeted for criminal and civil enforcement for receiving S.D. or other currency payments that flowed through the U.S. financial system. By contrast, the Sojitz settlement and OFAC’s 2017 landmark TransTel enforcement action involved a company initiating U.S.D. payments involving Iranian business or goods and thereby causing U.S. intermediary banks to export financial services to a sanctioned country. Regardless of which way funds flow, the facts may support criminal and civil sanctions liability.
Be Aware of Expanding China-related Risks. China sanctions and export controls continued to expand during the first year of the Biden Administration. Although the sanctions targeting China are nowhere near a comprehensive embargo, they are in part reflective of a bipartisan belief that China is a threat to U.S. national security and to human rights. Over the course of 2021, the U.S. government took a number of measures to expand the scope of U.S. sanctions and export controls beyond activities occurring or relating to the Xinjiang province or persons involved in imposing PRC law on Hong Kong, to more broadly target the surveillance and military sectors of the Chinese economy. During 2021, the U.S. government also placed a number of Chinese individuals and companies on various sanctioned person and export control restricted parties lists. The U.S. government has also taken actions to implement regulations regarding the use of certain Chinese-origin information and communications technology and services in the United States via the ICTS Rule.
Consider Testing and Addressing Sanctions Screening Software Limitations. OFAC’s Payoneer and First Bank settlements make clear that the utilization of defective screening software will not provide a shield against regulatory enforcement. Companies should consider devoting resources—commensurate with the scale and sophistication of their operations—to understanding the functionality and limitations of their sanctions screening software, ensure sufficient staff training, update the software regularly, and periodically evaluate the software with test data to ensure that it sufficiently flags transactions even absent an exact match.
Consider Implementing Internet Protocol Blocking and Other Geolocational Tools. OFAC continues to focus on the controls that companies have in place to prevent transactions with sanctioned jurisdictions. In particular, OFAC expects companies to screen geolocation information from IP addresses and block transactions involving comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions, a principal reiterated in its action against BitPay and its guidance for the cryptocurrency industry. The cryptocurrency guidance also expresses an expectation that companies will employ methods to detect attempts, such as the use of VPNs, to defeat IP blocking. 
Understand U.S. Touchpoints that Create Sanctions Risk. Non-U.S. persons conducting business with sanctioned jurisdictions or sanctioned parties should understand the ways in which involving U.S. persons (including U.S. person employees and U.S. person subsidiaries), U.S.-origin goods and software, or U.S.-based support or back-office services (including U.S. infrastructure such as servers), can expose such dealings to U.S. sanctions prohibition and enforcement risk. Non-U.S. entities involved in such dealings should consider assessing any potential U.S.-nexus and implementing appropriate controls to avoid U.S. sanctions violations. 
Consider Incorporating AML/CFT Priorities. Although the issuance of the Department of the Treasury’s AML/CFT Priorities did not trigger any immediate changes in BSA requirements or regulatory expectations, financial institutions may want to begin to evaluate how they will incorporate and document the AML/CFT Priorities, where appropriate, into their risk-based AML programs. They may want to consider updates to the red flags they have incorporated into their compliance programs, and consider any potential technological changes that might be necessary. 
Monitor New Beneficial Ownership Requirements. Companies should consider reviewing the proposed rulemaking issued by FinCEN on December 7, 2021 that would implement the Corporate Transparency Act by requiring certain U.S. and non-U.S. entities to submit beneficial ownership and company applicant information to FinCEN. Companies may want to begin to assess whether they and their subsidiaries and other affiliates are required to file or whether they can avail themselves of various exemptions. Additionally, companies should consider incorporating compliance with these requirements into their processes for creating new legal entities. 
Monitor Developments and Guidance Arising from Expansion of BSA Requirements Under the AML Act Companies should consider reviewing and appropriately responding to guidance and regulations arising from the AML Act, in addition to the beneficial ownership rulemaking noted above. Among other items, companies subject to the BSA should consider reviewing the new whistleblower provisions of the AML Act, which may incentivize greater employee reporting to law enforcement. FinCEN has not yet enacted rules implementing the whistleblower provisions. Companies should consider ensuring that they have sufficient whistleblower and anti-retaliation policies in place, and that employees receive adequate training on these policies. 
Consider Evaluating Compliance Programs for Entities in the Virtual Currency Space. Recent regulatory actions and statements suggest that the Biden Administration will continue to be aggressive in its application of existing regulations—including AML and sanctions regulations—to those in the virtual currency space. Entities operating in this space should monitor guidance and enforcement actions to ensure that their compliance programs appropriately address sanctions and BSA/AML risk. Among other things, entities operating in this space should ensure that their due diligence procedures, CIPs, risk assessments, and transaction monitoring and screening are updated. Financial institutions working with virtual currency entities should also consider the unique risks of virtual currency companies, including virtual currency exchanges.

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson testifies during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on March 23, 2022.Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination brings renewed attention to lack of Black judges on the federal benchBy Chandelis Duster and Priya Krishnakumar, CNNUpdated 1403 GMT (2203 HKT) April 2, 2022 (CNN)As the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court has ignited a discussion about the historic lack of diversity on the nation's highest court, her ascendance has also renewed focus on the absence of Black judges on the federal judiciary's lower courts.Of the 3,852 people who have been confirmed as federal judges, a CNN analysis of data from the Federal Judicial Center shows that only 240 of them -- 6% -- have been Black. Just 71 of them have been Black women. More than three-quarters of all the judges have been White men.

And while strides have been made in recent years to improve the demographic makeup of the federal bench, the judiciary still skews dramatically toward White, male judges, especially when compared to the rest of the country. Almost 80% of all Article III judges -- the federal judges who are nominated by a US president and confirmed by the US Senate -- are White, and 71% are men, with large gaps persisting in Latino, Black and women's representation in the federal courts, the data shows, despite Black Americans accounting for 12.4% of the US population. 

That lack of representation is an obstacle for aspiring judges of color in a career pipeline when it comes to openings on the Supreme Court -- while also having a negative impact on a judicial system in which judges are expected to make fair and impartial decisions on issues affecting an ever-diversifying country, experts told CNN.Read More""One thing that we know erodes public confidence in the judiciary is when judges and other judicial actors (like juries) fails to reflect the diversity of the citizens who rely on our courts to mete out impartial justice,"" Stacy Hawkins, vice dean and professor at Rutgers Law School, told CNN. ""Citizens simply lack trust in the system when the system does not appear to adequately reflect their interests."" Wide-ranging reasons for lack of representationConstance Baker Motley, former Manhattan borough president, was named by President Lyndon Johnson in 1966 to fill a vacancy on the federal district court in New York City.Up until the 1960s, the federal bench was comprised almost exclusively of White men. In 1966, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Constance Baker Motley to the Southern District of New York, making her the first Black woman to become a federal judge. In the decade to follow, the federal bench saw a substantial increase in judges of color after former President Jimmy Carter announced a priority appointing more diverse judges. Overall, only 137 Hispanic Americans have been federal judges in US history, 53 have been Asian American and four have been Native American.There is a clear partisan divide in judicial appointments, with Democratic presidents nominating more Black and non-White judges to the federal bench than Republican presidents. In total, Democratic presidents have nominated 180 Black judges to the federal judiciary, while 60 were nominated by Republicans. Among Black federal judges who are still actively serving, 115 were nominated by Democrats, and 37 were nominated by Republicans. 

President Joe Biden has also emphasized diversity in many of his judicial appointments. Just over a year into his term, 67% of his confirmed nominees to the federal bench have been non-White, the highest share of any president. By comparison, just 16% of former President Donald Trump's confirmed nominees during his term were non-White. There are several reasons for a lack of diversity on the federal bench, law experts told CNN, including systemic discrimination, bias and unequal access to opportunities in the legal profession. Other factors include underrepresentation in judicial clerkships, prestigious experiences often seen in the background of judges, and underrepresentation in law firm partnerships. Early on, US Presidents, who have the power to appoint federal judges and accept recommendations for judicial candidates from lawmakers, including senators who vote on whether to confirm those appointed, also did not prioritize appointing diverse judges. There is also the fact that federal judges are appointed to their roles for life and not a set term. ""When you combine life tenure with increases in average life span, you have few opportunities for federal judicial vacancies. So, it takes a lot of time to shift the demographic composition of the bench through the appointments process,"" Hawkins told CNN, adding that because vacancies are so limited, there are often far more qualified judicial candidates than there are seats to fill. The lack of diverse representation on the bench also has a negative impact on the de facto pipeline in which aspiring judges climb the legal profession ranks.""The lack of diversity on the bench right now also kind of contributes to the lack of diversity on that pipeline because you don't have necessarily an expansive set of networks to help folks navigate those processes,"" Alicia Bannon, director of the judiciary program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told CNN. Black lawyers are already underrepresented in the legal profession more broadly, with only 5% of all lawyers being Black, according to the American Bar Association. And while progress has been made in employment among Black law graduates, narrowing gaps in employment are still quite considerable, according to an analysis by the National Association for Law Placement released in 2021. Law school enrollment over the past decade has declined by 25%, according to a study by the American Bar Federation looking at enrollment from 1999-2019. At that time, Black and Hispanic students made up a larger share of law school enrollment since the Great Recession, but Black and Hispanic students were disproportionately enrolled in lower-ranked schools with lower rates of bar passage and post-graduation employment, the study also found. ""The pipeline for judges runs through law schools,"" said Tomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University, adding that law school candidates have to be prepared by courses studied in college and in high school. ""There is a need to pay attention to increasing and ensuring equal opportunity at all levels of the educational system and in the legal profession."" 'Visible diversity breeds visible diversity'Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, left, administers the oath of office to US District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, right, with Jackson's husband Patrick Jackson, center, holding the Bible, during an official investiture ceremeony.  May 9, 2013.  One way to increase diversity on the federal bench is to increase the number of diverse legal professionals in the de facto pipeline to the federal bench and Black representation in law schools, experts told CNN. Judicial clerkships -- which are coveted and competitive opportunities for lawyers and graduates to shadow a judge -- allow one to gain upfront experience and insight into a judgeship itself. Law graduates of color are underrepresented in all levels of judicial clerkships, particularly at the federal level, according to an analysis by the National Association for Law Placement that was released in February 2021. Just 2.1% of Black graduates are at the federal clerkship level, the group found. US Presidents and lawmakers should also be committed to diversity in appointments and recommendations, Bannon told CNN. Role-modeling from the bench itself could also lead to a diverse pipeline and Brown-Nagin said Jackson's appointment could inspire other Black women to pursue judgeships. ""Visible diversity breeds visible diversity. Meaning, if Black women historically have not been appointed judges, then it stands to reason that Black women don't think that they're likely to be appointed judges. It's just a sort of a vicious circle,"" Brown-Nagin said. Jackson, a Harvard Law graduate who went on to serve on the federal judiciary for nearly a decade, clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer during the 1999 term; Judge Bruce M. Selya, a federal judge in Massachusetts; and US District Judge Patti Saris in Massachusetts. During her confirmation hearing, she spoke of the importance for law students of color to have access to clerkships and said her experience as a clerk ""changed the trajectory of her career."" ""It has been a part of my practice to go to schools, to reach out to young people, to tell them about clerking, to try to get them to apply to me if I can and to show them that this is something that is possible,"" Jackson said. ""If I can do it, they can do it. And I think it is to the benefit of us all to have as many different law students seeking clerkships as possible.""

NatWest fined £264.8 million for anti-money laundering failures 





 









NatWest fined £264.8 million for anti-money laundering failures

National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) was today fined £264,772,619.95 following convictions for three offences of failing to comply with money laundering regulations.




Mrs Justice Cockerill, the sentencing judge at Southwark Crown Court, today said: '….it must be borne in mind that although in no way complicit in the money laundering which took place, the Bank was functionally vital. Without the Bank – and without the Bank’s failures - the money could not be effectively laundered.' 
NatWest pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates Court on 7 October. This is the first time the FCA has pursued criminal charges for money laundering failings.
The charges covered NatWest’s failure to properly monitor the activity of a commercial customer, Fowler Oldfield, a jewellery business based in Bradford, between 8 November 2012 to 23 June 2016. When taking on the customer, NatWest initially understood it would not handle cash from the Fowler Oldfield business. However, over the course of the customer relationship approximately £365m was deposited with the bank, of which around £264m was in cash.
Some of the bank’s employees, who were responsible for handling these cash deposits, reported their suspicions to bank staff responsible for investigating suspected money laundering, however no appropriate action was ever taken. The ‘red flags’ that were reported included significant amounts of Scottish bank notes deposited throughout England, deposits of notes carrying a prominent musty smell, and individuals acting suspiciously when depositing cash in NatWest branches. In addition, the bank’s automated transaction monitoring system incorrectly recognised some cash deposits as cheque deposits. As cheques carry a lower money laundering risk than cash, this was a significant gap in the bank’s monitoring of a large number of customers depositing cash, of which Fowler Oldfield was one.
A separate investigation by West Yorkshire Police has led to 11 people pleading guilty to charges relating to the cash deposits and three cash couriers being charged. A further 13 individuals are awaiting trial at Leeds Crown Court on 25 April 2022 in relation to the activities of Fowler Oldfield.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
'NatWest is responsible for a catalogue of failures in the way it monitored and scrutinised transactions that were self-evidently suspicious. Combined with serious systems failures, like the treatment of cash deposits as cheques, these failures created an open door for money laundering.
'Anti-money laundering controls are a vital part of the fight against serious crime, like drug trafficking, and such failures are intolerable ones that let down the whole community, which, in this case, justified the FCA’s first criminal prosecution under the Money Laundering Regulations.'
Notes to editors
The fine reflected a discount for the plea of guilty. The figure before 1/3 reduction for plea is £397,156,944.14.
Sentencing remarks: 
NatWest failed to comply with Money Laundering Regulations (2007). The Money Laundering Regulations 2007 came into force on 15 December 2007 and form part of the UK’s legislative framework designed to prevent the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. They were superseded by the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017. 
Full details of the case against NatWest are available in the following agreed Statement of Facts  
National Westminster Bank Plc is a subsidiary of NatWest Group Plc (formerly the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc).

Europe's human rights court has ordered Italy to pay Amanda Knox around 18,000 euros ($20,000) in financial damages for police failure to provide legal assistance and a translator during questioning following the Nov. 1, 2007 killing of her British roommate. The European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg, France, on Thursday ruled that Italy must pay Knox 10,400 euros damages plus 8,000 euros for costs and expenses.

Europe’s human rights court on Thursday ordered Italy to pay Amanda Knox financial damages for police failure to provide legal assistance and a translator during a long night of questioning following the Nov. 1, 2007 murder of her British roommate. But the court said there was insufficient evidence to support claims of psychological and physical mistreatment at the hands of police.
The European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg, France, said in its ruling that Italy hadn’t succeeded in proving that “the restriction of Ms. Knox’s access to a lawyer … had not irreparably undermined the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.” It ordered damages that Italy must pay Knox 18,400 euros ($27,000) in damages, costs and expenses.“Ms. Knox had been particularly vulnerable, being a foreign young woman, 20 at the time, not having been in Italy for very long and not being fluent in Italian,” the court noted.

 After more than seven years of legal battles and flip-flop decisions, Knox, now 31, was definitively acquitted of Meredith Kercher’s murder by Italy’s highest court in March 2015, but a damaging conviction for falsely accusing a Congolese bar owner of the murder was confirmed, leaving a cloud over her acquittal.WATCH: Amanda Knox, former boyfriend acquitted of 2007 murder in Italy (2015) It was during questioning in the wee hours of Nov. 6, 2007 that Knox accused Patrick Lumumba, the owner of a bar where she sometimes worked, of the murder. Knox’s defence had long claimed that the accusation was coerced. The court noted she had quickly and repeatedly retracted the statement, citing a hand-written statement on the afternoon of Nov. 6, 2007, another for her lawyers three days later and in a wiretapped call to her mother on Nov. 10, 2007.

 Knox’s defence attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said the decision “is not a big surprise for me because the supreme court already said there were many mistakes. That is one of the reasons that invited us to tell Amanda to go to Strasbourg.”WATCH: Amanda Knox says she is grateful to have her life back (2015) “For me this is a certification of a mistake, probably the biggest legal mistake in the last years in Italy, also because the attention that this case has had,” Dalla Vedova said. He said he was considering whether to challenge the standing conviction for malicious false accusations.“It is impossible to compensate Amanda for four years in prison for a mistake. There will be no amount. We are not looking for compensation of damages. We are doing this on principal,” he said.  Story continues below advertisement

The bank has been accused by Austrac of more than 20m breaches of money laundering and counter-terrorism laws.  Photograph: David Moir/EPABen ButlerTue 19 Nov 2019 22.53 GMTLast modified on Thu 21 Nov 2019 02.38 GMTAustralia’s financial intelligence agency has launched legal action against one of the country’s biggest banks, Westpac, accusing it of more than 23m breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws involving $11bn in transactions, including transfers potentially linked to child exploitation.In a statement filed with the federal court, Austrac said Westpac had failed to “carry out appropriate due diligence on customers sending money to the Philippines and South East Asia for known child exploitation risks”.Austrac said Westpac had been aware of the child exploitation risks relating to low-value payments made through one of its systems, LitePay, since 2013 but had not fixed them until June 2018.“Westpac still has not implemented appropriate automated detection scenarios to monitor for the known child exploitation risks through other channels,” Austrac told the court. “As a result, Westpac has failed to detect activity on its customers’ accounts that is indicative of child exploitation.”Westpac also failed to properly deal with a customer who “opened a number of Westpac accounts after serving a custodial sentence for child exploitation offences”, Austrac said.Commonwealth Bank profits slump as compliance bill surges by $1bnRead more“Westpac promptly identified activity on one account that was indicative of child exploitation, but failed to promptly review activity on other accounts.“This customer continued to send frequent low value payments to the Philippines through channels that were not being monitored appropriately.”The customer was among 12 on whom Austrac claims Westpac failed to carry out appropriate due diligence checks “with a view to identifying, mitigating and managing known child exploitation risks”.“Over a number of years, there were repeated patterns of frequent low value transactions on accounts held by each of these 12 customers that were indicative of child exploitation risks,” the regulator told the court.Austrac also accused Westpac of failing to properly assess the risk in dealing with correspondent banks with which it did business.“This is in spite of a number of correspondent banks disclosing higher ML/TF (money laundering and terror finance) risks, such as themselves having correspondent banking relationships with high risk or sanctioned countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, and Democratic Republic of Congo,” Austrac said.“Some correspondent banks who had disclosed such relationships had been fined by overseas regulators for sanctions or AML/CTF breaches resulting from inadequate controls.“The risk posed to Westpac was that these high risk or sanctioned countries may have been able to access the Australian payment system through these nested arrangements, unbeknownst to Westpac.”Austrac also said that between November 2013 and September 2018, Westpac failed to give it reports within the 10 days required by law about almost three-quarters of the incoming fund transfers it received from overseas banks – some 19.5m transactions totalling more than $11bn.In addition, the bank failed to file timely reports about more than 12,000 outbound transactions, including more than 2,300 sent through LitePay where “Westpac has never given Austrac a report of each of these instructions”, Austrac said.Westpac faces a theoretical maximum fine of between $391tn and $483tn, but if the breaches are found by the court it is unlikely to be ordered to pay anywhere near that amount.However, based on Austrac’s recent track record, any penalty would be likely to be extremely large.Last year, rival big four bank CBA agreed to pay Austrac $700m to settle a similar action against it in which the regulator alleged more than 53,000 breaches of AML-CTF laws.Westpac revealed it was under investigation by Austrac in November last year.“The group has recently self-reported to Austrac a failure to report a large number of international funds transfer instructions,” the bank said in its 2018 annual report.“No provision has been raised for this matter including in relation to any potential regulatory action.”In a statement to the stock exchange on Wednesday morning, Westpac said it was “reviewing Austrac’s statement of claim and will issue a further statement to the ASX once it has been assessed”.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he was “appalled” by the allegations but the lawsuit proved Austrac was doing its job.The bank is expected to make a further

Angered by the West’s economic sanctions, President Vladimir Putin ordered that “unfriendly” countries must start paying for Russian natural gas in roubles, a demand that ministers from the G7 group of countries refused. Gas prices began to rise at the prospect that Mr Putin would turn off the taps. On March 30th Germany began bracing for the worst, taking its first step towards gas rationing. By the end of the day, however, the German government said it had received assurances that European firms would not have to make payments in roubles.Listen to this story.

The EU has vowed to slash imports of natural gas from Russia, which made up some 40% of its consumption of the fuel last year, by two-thirds by the end of 2022. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, dreams that the EU can “get rid” of Russian imports entirely within a few years. Can America, one of the world’s largest natural-gas exporters, help fill the gap?When the Trump administration tried to persuade European officials to reduce their reliance on Russian energy by implementing policies to import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from America—which it dubbed “molecules of freedom”—the proposal was ridiculed. Yet President Joe Biden finds himself doing something very similar to his predecessor. On March 25th he and Ms von der Leyen announced a “groundbreaking” plan to help end the EU’s reliance on Russian gas. It calls for American help in securing an additional 15bn cubic metres of LNG for Europe this year (equal to roughly a tenth of total European imports of Russian gas in 2021). It also promises to “ensure additional EU market demand” for 50bn cubic metres per year of the fuel from America by 2030.Industry insiders have greeted the ambitious plan with scepticism. One reason is that American gas companies face severe infrastructure constraints. The share of American exports going to Europe shot up from 4% in 2017 to almost 30% last year (equivalent to 22bn cubic metres), as prices soared on the continent. America “has almost 100% of its liquefaction capacity already in use”, reckons Rystad, a research firm, meaning that “there is no additional LNG to be exported” in the short term. Jack Fusco, boss of Cheniere, a big American energy company, confirms that his firm is “maxed out”. It would take four or five years and tens of billions of dollars in investment, not to mention the fast-tracking of regulatory approvals, to change that.There are also questions about whether the EU has the infrastructure to cope with the imports. Receiving cargoes of LNG and converting them into usable natural gas requires big facilities for regasification. Europe has spare capacity, but much of it is on the coasts of western countries like Spain and France. Poor interconnections mean that these are not very useful in getting imports to eastern parts of the EU, where an embargo would hit hardest. Germany, which has no LNG terminals, has vowed to build two, but that will take several years. Some European countries talk of acquiring floating LNG terminals, which can be set up more quickly—but there is a severe global shortage of them.Look to the longer term, though, and the new approach to natural gas shows more promise. That is because the EU appears ready to jettison its misguided hostility to long-term gas contracts, which it had discouraged as part of its effort to boost spot markets for gas. The intent had been to promote competition, but, as last winter’s rocketing gas prices revealed, it also left Europe badly exposed to a supply shock. As a top American LNG exporter explains, Europe focused on expanding the spot market when it should have secured “fantastic” long-term pricing instead.Now the commission says it will encourage long-term contracts “to support final investment decisions on both LNG export and import infrastructure”. That should give investors in American export facilities the confidence to spend the billions required, boosting transatlantic trade. Giles Farrer of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, reckons that the infrastructure needed to achieve the aim of 50bn cubic metres of liquefaction capacity in America would cost roughly $25bn, not including upstream investments and supply-chain inflation. Rystad thinks the spending needed to meet Europe’s extra demand could be in the region of $35bn.Diversification away from Russia in the long term, then, may be possible. But that does little to help with the short-term problem of an aggressive Mr Putin. A rational calculus suggests that he should be unwilling to turn off the taps, considering he profits handsomely from high prices. Energy Intelligence, an industry publisher, reckons Gazprom earned $20.5bn from European gas sales in the first two months of the year, nearly as much as it made from Europe in all of 2020. But few observers would dare to predict the actions of an increasingly erratic dictator. ■For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly newsletter.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""A little help from a friend""Reuse this contentThe Trust ProjectMore from Finance & economicsDiversionary tacticsWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?Side channelsIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketButtonwoodCan the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?Wounded bearUnder unprecedented sanctions, how is the Russian economy faring?More from Finance & economicsWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketThe question is how to pay for Russian oilCan the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?Past experience suggests soft landings are rareWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketThe question is how to pay for Russian oilCan the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?Past experience suggests soft landings are rareUnder unprecedented sanctions, how is the Russian economy faring?Better than you might thinkSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentThe Trust ProjectHelp and contact usKeep updatedFacebookInstagramTwitterLinkedInYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreStoreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist EventsWorking HereWhich MBA?GMAT TutorGRE TutorExecutive JobsExecutive Education NavigatorExecutive Education: The New Global OrderExecutive Education: Business WritingTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCopyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2022.

Money Laundering
AML expert sentenced in money laundering case2021-08-02T15:48:00+01:00











 














No comments








The former chairman of an industry group who provided anti-money laundering advice and training to lawmakers and financial regulators has been sentenced for offences related to money laundering.Dominic Thorncroft faced one charge of failing to alert the authorities to money laundering, one of breaching money laundering regulations and four charges of retaining a wrongful credit.
Thorncroft, former chairman of the Association of UK Payment Institutions, was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, by a crown court in London. He was also ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work.
Specialist prosecutor Stephane Pendered said: “Dominic Thorncroft did not commit the fraud himself. However, his actions have allowed £850,000 defrauded from 60 individuals to be dispersed across the world.” The sum equates to $1.18m or €995,000.
She added: “Thorncroft promoted himself as an anti-money laundering expert but failed to live up to the standards he set for others, so when his business was clearly being used to launder criminal property, he failed to follow his own advice and report what was happening to the authorities.”
According to Britain’s CPS prosecution service an investigation by London-based Metropolitan Police began in 2016 found evidence linking Thorncroft to an investment fraud which took place in 2014. He had allowed his Money Service Bureau business to be used by the fraudsters to transfer money to Hong Kong and China.
The CPS and the police were able to prove that Thorncroft should have known or suspected that the money passing through his business’s bank accounts was criminal property, the CPS said
“Despite his substantial knowledge and expertise of money laundering, Thorncroft failed to alert the authorities to the suspicious activity and allowed it to continue,” it added.
Thorncroft’s legal representative Kevin Baumber told the court his offending was “characterised by incompetence not deliberation” and he did not have “a guilty mind or sinister motives”, the Financial Times reported.
The presiding judge said it should have been obvious to him that his company was being used to launder money even though the fraud had been sophisticated and well executed. Thorncroft did not benefit financially from the offences, he added.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Third Founder Of Cryptocurrency Exchange Pleads Guilty To Bank Secrecy Act Violations
Samuel Reed Designed BitMEX as a Platform to Flout U.S. Anti-Money Laundering Rules
Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that SAMUEL REED, one of three co-founders and a high-ranking executive of purportedly “off-shore” cryptocurrency derivatives exchange the Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange or “BitMEX,” pled guilty today to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (the “BSA”) by willfully failing to establish, implement, and maintain an anti-money laundering (“AML”) program at BitMEX.  Under the terms of his plea agreement, REED agreed to separately pay a $10 million criminal fine representing pecuniary gain derived from the offense.  REED pled guilty today before Chief U.S. District Judge Laura T. Swain, and will be sentenced by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl.  The other two founders of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, previously pled guilty to the same offense in February 2022.
U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said:  “Samuel Reed has now joined his co-founders, Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, in admitting that they caused BitMEX to commit criminal violations of the anti-money laundering laws that govern financial institutions operating in the United States.  As today’s guilty plea reflects, this Office will not permit cryptocurrency exchanges to operate as a shadow financial system that enables criminal actors to move their illicit proceeds without detection, and will vigorously investigate and prosecute the operators of such exchanges who deliberately flout U.S. law.”
According to the Indictment, public court filings, and statements made in court:[1]
REED, together with Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, was one of the three co-founders and the long-time Chief Technology Officer of BitMEX.  BitMEX is an online cryptocurrency derivatives exchange that, during the relevant time period, had U.S.-based operations and served thousands of U.S. customers, notwithstanding false representations to the contrary by the company.  From at least September 2015, and continuing at least through the time of the Indictment in September 2020, REED willfully caused BitMEX to fail to establish and maintain an AML program, including a program for verifying the identify of BitMEX’s customers (or a “know your customer” or “KYC” program).  As a result of its willful failure to implement AML and KYC programs, BitMEX was in effect a money laundering platform.  For example, in about May 2018, REED was notified of allegations that BitMEX was being used to launder the proceeds of a cryptocurrency hack.  Neither REED nor the company filed a suspicious activity report thereafter (indeed, BitMEX filed no suspicious activity reports at all between 2014 and September 2020), nor did BitMEX implement an AML or KYC program in response. 
REED failed to institute AML or KYC programs at BitMEX despite closely following U.S. regulatory developments that made clear his legal obligation to do so if BitMEX operated in the United States, which it did.  Despite repeatedly stating that BitMEX did not serve U.S. customers, including to individuals outside of BitMEX, REED knew that BitMEX’s purported withdrawal from the U.S. market in or about September 2015 was a sham, and that purported “controls” BitMEX put in place to prevent U.S. trading were an ineffective facade that did not, in fact, prevent users from accessing or trading on BitMEX from the United States.  REED not only understood that U.S. customers continued to trade on BitMEX, but derived substantial profits from BitMEX as a result of U.S.-based trading. 
*                *                *
REED, 32, of Massachusetts, pled guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison.  The maximum potential sentence in this case is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the judge.
Mr. Williams praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI’s New York Money Laundering Investigation Squad, and thanked the attorneys and investigators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission whose expertise and diligence were integral to the development of this investigation.
The prosecution is being handled by the Office’s Money Laundering and Transnational Criminal Enterprises Unit.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jessica Greenwood, Samuel Raymond, and Thane Rehn are in charge of the prosecution. 


[1] Two of REED’s co-defendants, Arthur Hayes and Benjamin Delo, pled guilty to violating the BSA in February 2022. As to REED’s remaining co-defendant, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described should be treated as an allegation.

Tencent also failed to fully comply with rules around checking the identity of merchants and individuals as well as the source of their funds, the newspaper said.Tencent was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC Monday.Shares in the tech firm fell nearly 10% to close at 331.80 Hong Kong dollars ($42.38), their lowest closing level since Dec. 5, 2019.Since a record high close of 766.50 Hong Kong dollars in January 2021, Tencent shares have shed around 56%, wiping off more than $500 billion of value off the company.The WSJ report comes after more than a year of intense regulatory tightening by Beijing on the country's technology sector that has sought to rein in the power and stamp out some of the alleged bad behaviors of the biggest technology companies. China has sought to introduce regulation in areas ranging from anti-trust to data protection.A particular focus of regulators has been non-bank financial players such as Tencent and Alibaba-affiliate Ant Group. These companies offer financial services but traditionally without the strict regulation that banks face. China is looking to change that.Tencent has, so far, managed to escape a major regulatory blow, unlike Alibaba and Meituan which have both been hit with anti-trust fines.The Wall Street Journal said that Tencent's potential fine could be at least hundreds of millions of yuan, but it is still under deliberation.The Hong Kong-listed shares of other Chinese tech names also took a battering on Monday as already-fragile sentiment towards the country's internet sector continues to get tested.China is facing a new wave of Covid infections across the country leading to lockdowns in cities and factories closing. Meanwhile, investors are still on edge about whether U.S.-listed Chinese companies could face delistings and if Beijing's regulatory onslaught will continue.TVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT |   ETListenTVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT |   ETListenSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

In the coming weeks NatWest, one of Britain’s largest lenders, is set to appear in court in London to respond to charges that it failed to properly scrutinise a gold-dealing client that deposited £365m ($502m) with the bank—£264m of it in cash.Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Listen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNatWest (which has said it is co-operating with investigators) is the latest lender to be accused of falling short in the fight against dirty money. Last year global banks were hit with $10.4bn in fines for money-laundering violations, an increase of more than 80% on 2019, according to Fenergo, a compliance-software firm. In January Capital One, an American bank, was fined $390m for failing to report thousands of fishy transactions. Danske Bank is still dealing with the fallout of a scandal that erupted in 2018. Over $200bn of potentially dirty money was washed through the Danish lender’s Estonian branch while executives missed or ignored a sea of red flags.These cases imply that banks remain the Achilles heel in the global war on money-laundering, despite the reams of regulations aimed at turning them into frontline soldiers in that conflict. However, closer examination suggests that the global anti-money-laundering (AML) system has serious structural flaws, largely because governments have outsourced to the private sector much of the policing they should have been doing themselves.A study published last year by Ronald Pol, a financial-crime expert, concluded that the global AML system could be “the world’s least effective policy experiment”, and that compliance costs for banks and other businesses could be more than 100 times higher than the amount of laundered loot seized. A report based on a survey of professionals, published last year by LexisNexis, an analytics firm, found that worldwide spending on AML and sanctions compliance by financial institutions (including fund managers, insurers and others, as well as banks) exceeds $180bn a year.Money-laundering was not even a crime across much of the world until the 1980s. Since then countries from Afghanistan to Zambia have been arm-twisted, particularly by America, into passing laws. The effort intensified after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the passage of America’s Patriot Act, which targeted money trails financing terrorism and other crime.AML compliance has since become a huge part of what banks do and created large new bureaucracies. It is not unusual for firms such as HSBC or JPMorgan Chase to have 3,000-5,000 specialists focused on fighting financial crime, and more than 20,000 overall in risk and compliance.The AML push has succeeded in stamping out the most pernicious practices, such as using shell banks (those with no real customers) in sunny places to launder suitcases stuffed with drug money. But criminals have not been forced to get particularly creative: it is not much more difficult today than it was 20 years ago to rinse dirty money by setting up a shell company, disguising the loot flowing through it as legitimate revenue and persuading an established bank to process it.As a result, the numbers tell of a war being lost. The “Global Threat Assessment”, a report by John Cusack, an ex-chair of the Wolfsberg Group, an association of banks that helps develop AML standards, estimates that $5.8trn-worth of financial crime was perpetrated in 2018—equivalent to 6.7% of global GDP. Statistics on how much is intercepted by authorities are patchy. A decade-old estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime put it at just 0.2% of the total. In 2016 Europol estimated the confiscation rate in Europe to be a higher but still paltry 1.1%.Some experts think the success rate may have fallen in recent years, in part because of the rise of “trade-based money-laundering”—which moves dodgy money into the legitimate economy by playing tricks with paperwork for cross-border trade. The covid-19 pandemic, too, has boosted opportunities for financial ne’er-do-wells. Criminals have set up shell companies to exploit vast, poorly policed government-aid schemes. In Britain, the authorities have received more than 50,000 reports of potential misuse of its “Bounce Back Loans” and furlough schemes.Shell shockThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental body that sets global AML standards, admits to problems with the system. Last October its president, Marcus Pleyer, accused the “vast majority” of countries of failing to tackle money-laundering. Some countries have been able to achieve solid marks in the organisation’s assessments by passing nice-looking AML laws, only to water them down later or fail to implement key provisions. One offender is the United Arab Emirates, where weak enforcement has helped Dubai become a haven for corrupt capital. But America and Britain also look to game the FATF process, albeit less egregiously.Global efforts to stamp out money-laundering have, if anything, waned over the past five years, says Robert Barrington of the University of Sussex. In 2016 David Cameron, Britain’s then prime minister, hosted a global anti-corruption summit, and other governments queued up to back the cause. But it proved a false dawn. Britain became distracted by Brexit. In America, President Donald Trump showed scant leadership on the issue. China and Russia have stymied attempts to co-ordinate action against corruption.Three big problems hobble the fight against financial crime: a lack of transparency; a lack of collaboration; and a lack of resources. Start with transparency. Investigators often struggle to identify the real, “beneficial”, owners of shell companies, who often hide behind legal nominees.Some progress has been made in increasing visibility. Britain launched a public register of company owners in 2016, spurring several others to follow suit. Britain’s offshore satellites, such as the British Virgin Islands and Jersey, have been pressed into setting up registers or strengthening existing ones. America recently passed a law requiring ownership data on firms registered at state level, including in Delaware’s incorporation factories, to be held in a federal register.However, many countries still eschew registers, and those that have them have faced problems. In Britain criminals have been willing to risk filing false information, or none at all, given the modest penalties for doing so. Hong Kong, meanwhile, plans to scale back the details company owners must disclose on its register.The FATF is seeking to toughen its standard on beneficial-ownership transparency; the current version says merely that “competent authorities” should have access to such information “in a timely fashion”. But getting its 39 core members—from America and the EU to China and Russia—to agree on a new text will be difficult.The second problem, lack of collaboration, hobbles governments’ work with each other, and with banks on the front line. The big money-laundering schemes are sophisticated and transnational, while anti-laundering efforts remain balkanised. Information-sharing between governments is improving, thanks to co-operation among “financial-intelligence units”, national centres that collect data on suspicious transactions. But the “mutual legal assistance” system, which countries investigating crimes use to request information from each other, is clunky.As for data flowing to and from banks, the benefits of sharing are indisputable. “The value of information coming from a network of banks is thousands of times higher than the information any one bank has, because you can see not just where the money came from, but where it went, and where it went from there, and so on,” says the head of a large international bank. Unfortunately, the level of collaboration is “terrible”. America does best, thanks to the Patriot Act, but even there information-sharing is “on a tiny scale”. Anything more requires a warrant from a judge, “which is hard if you don’t know what the crime is yet”. Britain is in second place, he says, with “about 30%” of the data-sharing done in America. And in third place? “No one.”A daunting obstacle to sharing information is data-privacy laws, which in many places prevent banks from passing information to authorities, particularly foreign ones. Some big banks have lobbied for exceptions to be made for AML, but “governments don’t see it as a legislative priority”, says an executive at another bank.The third difficulty, a dearth of resources, stems from the fact that white-collar crime is less visible than violent crime. Spending on curbing the latter goes down better with the public. In Britain, fraud makes up more than a third of reported crime, yet gets less than 1% of police resources in terms of officers. Banks can spend all they like on AML, but the criminals won’t end up in court if governments fail to invest in policing and prosecution.Many crime-fighting agencies lack the funding to properly analyse the torrent of “suspicious-activity reports” (SARS) banks file when they spot potentially dodgy transactions. SARs are a cornerstone of the system. But banks file too many low-quality or unnecessary reports because they are incentivised to cover their backs rather than to apply sensible risk criteria. Globally they file millions of SARs a year; in America alone, about 1.2m were submitted by deposit-takers last year (see chart).Red-tape revolutionIf the AML system is to be fit for purpose, then governments must work harder together. “Blaming banks for not ‘properly’ implementing [AML] laws is a convenient fiction,” Mr Pol’s report concluded. It also gives an unfair pass to the non-bank actors that enable corruption. While fines for banks with poor AML controls have risen relentlessly, lawyers who set up dodgy shell companies, accountants who sign off on their fishy filings and the like have been getting away with slaps on the wrist. Britain’s revenues and customs agency, for instance, supervises more than 30,000 accountants, estate agents and other businesses for money-laundering purposes; in the 2019-20 financial year it issued just 31 fines, averaging £290,000. Governments also need to get to grips with the AML implications of cryptocurrencies, and the firms and exchanges that hawk them.Activists who campaign to fix the cracks in the global AML architecture are pinning much hope on the Biden administration, which has said that it views the fight against corruption as a national-security issue and therefore a priority. Whether it can work more profitably than its predecessor with Europe, which is overhauling AML oversight in the wake of the Danske debacle, remains to be seen. Hopes that China can be persuaded to co-operate are not high. Either way, bankers should probably brace for another beating. ■A version of this article appeared online on April 12th, 2021.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""Losing the war""Reuse this contentThe Trust ProjectMore from Finance & economicsA little help from a friendAmerica’s gas frackers limber up to save EuropeDiversionary tacticsWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?Side channelsIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketButtonwoodCan the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?Wounded bearUnder unprecedented sanctions, how is the Russian economy faring?More from Finance & economicsAmerica’s gas frackers limber up to save EuropeThere might be little they can do in the short termWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketThe question is how to pay for Russian oilAmerica’s gas frackers limber up to save EuropeThere might be little they can do in the short termWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketThe question is how to pay for Russian oilCan the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?Past experience suggests soft landings are rareUnder unprecedented sanctions, how is the Russian economy faring?Better than you might thinkSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentThe Trust ProjectHelp and contact usKeep updatedFacebookInstagramTwitterLinkedInYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreStoreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist EventsWorking HereWhich MBA?GMAT TutorGRE TutorExecutive JobsExecutive Education NavigatorExecutive Education: The New Global OrderExecutive Education: Business WritingTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCopyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2022.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Friday, April 1, 2022 
MS-13 Leader Sentenced to Life in Federal Prison for Racketeering Conspiracy and Murder
Defendant Directed and/or Participated in Murders in Maryland and Virginia
A New Jersey man was sentenced to life in prison today for murder in aid of racketeering; conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering; conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, cocaine, and heroin; and possession with intent to distribute heroin.
Miguel Angel Corea Diaz aka Reaper, 41, of Long Branch, a leader in the transnational criminal enterprise La Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13, was convicted by a federal jury on Nov. 23, 2021, after a four-week trial. Co-defendant Junior Noe Alvarado-Requeno aka Insolente and Trankilo, 24, of Landover, Maryland, was also convicted at trial and faces a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. He is scheduled to be sentenced on April 25.
According to court documents, MS-13 is a transnational gang composed primarily of immigrants or descendants from El Salvador. MS-13 has branches or “cliques” that operate throughout Frederick County, Anne Arundel County, Prince George’s County, and Montgomery County, Maryland and elsewhere on the East Coast. 
“The brutality of Corea Diaz is almost unfathomable,” said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to remove these violent gang members to keep our communities safe from the violence perpetrated by MS-13. With the help of members of our communities we will work to bring to justice those MS-13 members who commit these horrible crimes.”
“As members of MS-13, Corea Diaz and his co-conspirators were ruthless and showed no regard for human life by extorting innocent people, tampering with witnesses, and ordering a murder over a drug dispute,” said Assistant Director in Charge Steven M. D’Antuono of the FBI Washington Field Office. “With today’s sentence, Corea Diaz will no longer be able to commit senseless violence and homicidal acts on our streets. The FBI remains steadfast in our resolve to work with our partners to ensure that individuals like Corea Diaz are held accountable for their crimes and to eliminate MS-13's violence from our communities.”
“The ruthlessness of MS-13 in pursuit of profits shows a clear link between violence and the illicit drug trade,” said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. “Today’s sentence won’t undo the harm Diaz is responsible for, but it ensures that for the rest of his life, he will no longer be a direct threat to the communities he terrorized for so long. DEA will continue to work tirelessly with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to ensure violent criminals like Diaz are taken off the streets, helping to make American communities safer and healthier.”
“Any time we can get a notorious gang member off the streets, it is a victory for both law enforcement and law-abiding citizens,” said Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore. “In this case, the criminal is particularly violent, and now he will face the consequences of his crimes.  HSI is grateful to have worked with our partnering federal and local law enforcement agencies to make the communities safer for the citizens of Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia.”
According to evidence presented at trial, between 2015 and 2018, Corea Diaz and his co-defendant Alvarado-Requeno controlled and operated the Sailors Locos Salvatruchos Westside (S.L.S.W. or Sailors) Clique. This Sailors Clique was involved in a host of significant criminal activity including murder, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering, and witness tampering. Evidence showed that the gang ran a “protection” scheme in and around its home base in Langley Park, Maryland, and extorted local businesses by charging them “rent” for the privilege of operating in MS-13 “territory.” The gang also trafficked in illegal drugs, including heroin and cocaine. A large share of the proceeds of the gang’s illegal activities were sent to gang leadership in El Salvador using structured transactions and intermediaries to avoid law enforcement scrutiny.
According to evidence presented at trial, the Sailors Clique committed acts of violence against suspected rival gang members, as well as against its own membership for breaking gang rules. In March 2017, a member of the Sailors Clique who was hiding from law enforcement in the Lynchburg, Virginia, area had a dispute with a local high school student over marijuana. In response, Corea-Diaz and Alvarado-Requeno organized a squad of MS-13 members to drive down to Lynchburg and murder the minor. The gang members kidnapped the student from his front lawn and cut his hand off before killing him. After the murder, Corea Diaz and Alvarado-Requeno helped to hide and protect the killers from law enforcement.
The FBI and HSI investigated the case, with valuable assistance provided by the DEA’s Washington and Buffalo Field Divisions, the Prince George’s County Police Department, the Montgomery County Police Department, the Bedford County Sherriff’s Office, and the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office.
Trial Attorneys Julie Finocchiaro and Alexander Gottfried of the Criminal Division’s Organized Crime and Gang Section and U.S. Attorney Timothy Hagan for the District of Maryland prosecuted the case.

FCA secures criminal conviction of NatWest for money laundering breaches
Posted on 8 October 2021


















On 7 October at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, NatWest entered guilty pleas to three counts of failure to prevent money laundering under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (MLR 2007). The charges were brought by the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'). The bank admitted it failed to comply with regulation 8(1) between 7 November 2013 until 23 June 2016, and regulations 8(3) and 14(1) between 8 November 2012 and 23 June 2016, in relation to the accounts of a UK incorporated customer.
The UK customer was Yorkshire-based gold dealership Fowler Oldfield Ltd. Between 7 November 2013 and 23 June 2016, Flower Oldfield deposited £365 million into its NatWest accounts, £264 million of which was in cash. Flower Oldfield subsequently shut down after police raided their premises in 2016.
The case has been sent to Southwark Crown Court for sentencing and the FCA intends to recommend a fine in the region of £340m.
Analysis
This case is noteworthy for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is the first criminal prosecution brought under the MLR 2007 by the FCA. It also confirms the FCA's decision and the wishes of its CEO to become a more  assertive, confident, decisive and agile regulator. This same sentiment was expressed by the FCA's Chairman Charles Randall at the FCA's Annual Public Meeting, which took place on the 28 September, where he stated that the regulator was undertaking a broad programme of change to become a more proactive and assertive regulator. 
The FCA's decision to pursue a criminal prosecution where a civil resolution was available should alert firms to how committed the regulator is to making full use of its powers in cases of tackling wrongdoing. Having already suffered criticism that it was slow to act in previous cases, the FCA has signalled that it will take a strict approach with offending parties in the future. The regulations under which NatWest was prosecuted do not require proof that money laundering has taken place.
The case serves as a reminder of the need for firms to have adequate procedures in place to prevent money laundering, particularly as it relates to ongoing monitoring of customer relationships.  At the outset of its relationship with Fowler Oldfield, it was agreed that NatWest would not handle cash deposits for the dealership, but across the relevant period it nevertheless accepted £264 million in cash. Indeed on one single day the dealership deposited £1.8 million in cash with the bank.
""Adequate risk-based due diligence and monitoring of client relationships must be an ongoing exercise for corporate entities who wish to safeguard themselves in the face of closer regulatory scrutiny and what promises to be an aggressive prosecutorial landscape going forward. Banks and other regulated firms must ensure that their systems are fit for purpose"" - Johanna Walsh, Partner in the White Collar Crime & Investigations Group

						Convicted money launderer who smuggled millions out of the UK wanted by the NCA

          Convicted money launderer who smuggled millions out of the UK wanted by the NCA        




            Money laundering          



The NCA is appealing for information on the whereabouts of a convicted money launderer who talked of moving up to £50 million out of the UK every month.
Abdul Fahad, 41, of Meads Lane, Ilford, was arrested by NCA officers in 2018 after bundles of cash totalling more than £100,000 were found in his car.

He was charged with multiple money laundering offences after further cash was located at his home, alongside evidence of frequent and suspicious trips to the United Arab Emirates.
Fahad initially told NCA officers that the cash seized had come from life savings, and from the sale of property and stocks.
He also stated he was a sole trader dealing in cars and that he intended to pay the money into a bank to buy a car.
However, the investigation found that Fahad was in regular contact with Sathar Khan, a money launderer jailed in 2018 for attempting to board a flight to Dubai with almost £1.5 million pounds cash in his suitcases.
Officers recovered messages from Fahad’s phone, showing a handwritten note detailing a schedule of dates for travel to Dubai between himself and Khan.
Between 2017 and 2018, the two men made nearly 200 return flights with both frequently travelling out with a significantly greater weight of luggage than they returned with.
NCA investigators estimate that Fahad left the UK with an extra 379 kilos over the offending period, which would equate to around £5 million in cash.
Messages on Fahad’s phone also detailed conversations with another would-be cash courier, with one message reading: “Giv me some work too… so I can earn too.’
Further messages revealed that Fahad and Khan discussed sending two couriers per day on money laundering runs during July and August 2018.
Money laundering experts estimate that, if successful, this may have seen up to £50 million moved out of the UK in the period.
Fahad appeared before Southwark Crown Court in September this year, where he pleaded guilty to three money laundering charges. He was granted bail but later absconded.
He was sentenced in his absence to eight years in prison on 16 December.
Law enforcement partners in the UAE provided valuable assistance to the NCA investigation.
Jason Hulme, Operations Manager at the National Crime Agency said:
“Fahad was at the heart of a multi-million-pound money laundering conspiracy, moving cash which would have been derived from serious and organised crime in the UK and internationally.
“We are seeking information on his whereabouts in order that he is made to serve his prison sentence. We believe he could be in East London, particularly around the Ilford or East Ham area and has connections to Dubai and Sri Lanka.
“Anyone with information should report to the NCA Control Centre on 0370 496 7622 quoting Operation Blissless or anonymously to Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”

I signed up for that’Joanna Partridge Doug Bannister at Dover’s cruise terminal. When he told his family he was taking the job, his father-in-law asked him: ‘Are you mad?’ Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverDoug Bannister at Dover’s cruise terminal. When he told his family he was taking the job, his father-in-law asked him: ‘Are you mad?’ Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverThe US executive took over the port in 2019, in the heat of the debate about the EU. He’s not surprised it’s been a challengeSat 2 Apr 2022 16.00 BSTLast modified on Sun 3 Apr 2022 01.13 BSTWhen Doug Bannister told his family he would be joining the Port of Dover as its chief executive, weeks before the original March 2019 Brexit date, his father-in-law voiced what many might have thought: “Are you mad?”The softly spoken American clearly isn’t one to shy away from a daunting task, including taking over at Britain’s busiest port during what he calls the “once in a generation” change in the country’s trading relationship with its closest neighbours.As negotiations dragged on, Brexit was delayed for another year, but when it came, the change was seismic. “It was such a significant transformation that the nation was going through, and Dover is the epicentre of that activity. And I did sign up for that,” Bannister says.Even if, on arrival, he was pleasantly surprised at the port’s preparations for Brexit, he never could have forecast the other storm clouds gathering on the horizon. Covid repeatedly disrupted traffic on Britain’s busiest trade route, halted most leisure travel for two years, and even saw France close its border in December 2020 to all travellers, including truck drivers, from England.The drop-off in traffic put pressure on the finances of the port, run by the Dover Harbour Board, which was granted a royal charter in 1606. It does not have any external shareholders, and its “trust port” status prevented it from tapping investors or going to the capital markets to raise cash during the pandemic.Freight traffic has largely returned to pre-Brexit, pre-pandemic levels at the UK’s most important “ro-ro” port (so named because vehicles roll on and roll off the ships), Bannister says, although leisure travel has been recovering more slowly. A third of all the UK’s trade in goods with the EU is handled by Dover, according to the latest figures from consultancy Oxera, which translates to a value of about £144bn. About 10,000 lorries travel through it each day – 31% of all the HGVs that visit UK seaports.CVAge 57Family Married with four children, three of whom live with him in Kent, while his eldest daughter lives in the US.Education BA in economics at St Lawrence University in New York state; MBA at Seton Hall University in New Jersey.Pay Basic salary of £300,000. In 2020 he was paid an additional £122,000 in bonuses, pension contributions and benefits.Last holiday Devon, last summer: “It was glorious.”Best advice he’s been given “Go into any change positively.” He believes “an early positive attitude” about change, “combined with early engagement, generally leads to a better outcome”.Biggest career mistake “I think I was not a good father to my first daughter. I was spending so much time working and travelling around the world for work that I missed her childhood. I have a very good relationship with her now.”Word he overuses “I probably use the word ‘wicked’ a lot.”How he relaxes Spending time with his children and in the garden.Bannister says he “fell into” his long maritime career after taking a job with small shipping group Trans Freight Lines in the US, following a degree in economics. The 57-year-old would go on to work at P&O’s container shipping division before it merged with Dutch line Royal Nedlloyd and was subsequently bought by the Danish giant Maersk.His latest challenge has arrived out of a clear blue sky: as we pulled up outside the passenger cruise terminal, an enormous symbol of it hove into view. P&O Ferries’ hulking Spirit of Britain hasn’t travelled anywhere since the company sacked 800 workers on 17 March. The 213-metre-long ferry, one of the largest operating in Europe, would usually only dock briefly at Dover during its five daily round trips between Kent and northern France.“We were looking forward to increasing passenger trade as Covid travel restrictions eased off, and so it is going to be difficult to handle that having the P&O ferries off the route. We hope they get them back sailing again in time for Easter, if not in time for the summer,” Bannister says.While P&O Ferries’ ships remain tied up, rival operators have scrambled to take extra passengers, with the port helping coordinate. Despite this, Bannister appears reluctant to pass judgment on the firm – whose chief executive effectively admitted breaching employment law by dismissing his staff without notice – or on the wider issue of rates of pay for international seafarers.Assessing wages for crew is not always straightforward as “frequently international seafarers don’t pay any income taxes, because they are not a part of any particular nation,” Bannister says. “Some routes are different, like domestic routes like the Isle of Wight or maybe up in the Scottish islands. It’s not necessarily a straight apples for apples comparison, but I do think it is right that people should get paid for the work that they do in the best way that they can be.”People will get slicker at reading passports, get slicker at lodging paperwork and checking paperwork. But we are in a different trading regimeDoug BannisterEven before the P&O scandal, port traffic had been repeatedly disrupted during the first weeks of the year, including by the introduction of new EU import controls, increased freight traffic, roadworks and a reduction in ferry services as vessels were refitted.Traffic was flowing freely on the day the Observer visited, and there was no sign of the queue of lorries frequently seen snaking up the A20 road, which winds down to the coast. Bannister believes this is partly due to traders and hauliers getting used to new requirements, which include time-consuming passport and paperwork checks.He concedes a consequence of Brexit is longer processing times at the border. “There will be improvements which are made. People will get slicker at reading passports, get slicker at lodging paperwork and checking paperwork. But we are in a different trading regime.”An impending change, which could again lead to queues at the port, is also weighing on Bannister’s mind. In September, the EU intends to introduce airport-style biometric checks at its external borders. This would affect Dover because of “juxtaposed controls”, where travellers clear French entry requirements before leaving the UK, and he has called on the British government to work with the EU on a solution.The Spirit of Britain (foreground) moored at Dover in the wake of the P&O scandal. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA“To date, no process has been identified for a carload of people transiting a busy ferry terminal on a dark stormy night,” he says. “It would force people to exit their vehicles in busy moving traffic, which would be dangerous. We couldn’t allow that to happen.”Over the centuries, Dover has capitalised on its “geographic advantage” of being located just 22 miles across the Channel from France. Bannister is convinced the recent bounceback in trade highlights the success of the “short straits”: the shortest distance between the UK and the continent. “The market has chosen,” he says. “We have three different ferry operators operating from the port, two ports in France to go to, and then the Eurotunnel running alongside us.”Bannister’s career has taken him on a circumnavigation of the globe from his home state of New Jersey to the island of Jersey – where he ran the airport and harbours – via Rotterdam, Australia (his favourite place to live and work) and New Zealand. Now, he clearly gets a kick out of working for an organisation as rich in history as this one, despite the varied challenges since he took up the role in Dover.“It’d be nice if there were a few less disruptions,” he says. “This business has been around for 400 years; it’s got incredible heritage. It’ll be here for another 400 years.”TopicsInternational tradeObserver business profileEconomicsGlobal economyBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policyinterviewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) has launched its first criminal prosecution for offences under the Money Laundering Regulations. It is also the first criminal prosecution against a bank for such offences. Previous FCA action has focussed on imposing fines for breaches and regulatory action over criminal prosecution.  However, they have been heavily criticised previously for failing to prosecute breaches. Does this case signal a new regulatory approach?




NatWest Bank is alleged to have accepted cash deposits of £264m without adequately monitoring and scrutinising the suspicious transaction behaviour. Following a four-year long investigation by the FCA, the bank has found itself before the Magistrates’ Court to defend itself against criminal failings to adhere to the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (“MLR”).  However, it is interesting to note that there are no individuals charged with any offences.  The penalties will therefore be financial in nature and will not result in a custodial sentence or criminal conviction for any individual.  The reputational damage, however, is likely to be significant for the bank as the case will be closely monitored as it the first time a bank has faced a criminal prosecution of this nature.

The FCA allege that NatWest failed in its obligation to conduct and demonstrate risk sensitive due diligence and ongoing monitoring of its relationships with its customers for the purposes of preventing money laundering. The issues arise from an account owned by a UK incorporated customer.  It is alleged that around £365 million was paid into the customer’s account, with £264 million paid in cash. NatWest’s handling of those deposits is said to have failed to adhere to the requirements of regulations 8(1), 8(3) and 14(1) of the MLR.

Regulations 8(1) and 8(3) MLR require a relevant person to conduct ongoing monitoring of a business relationship, including keeping up-to-date documents, data or information obtained for the purpose of applying customer due diligence measures. The regulations also provide for the ongoing monitoring of customer due diligence.

Regulation 14(1) MLR relates to enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring.  A relevant person is required to apply enhanced customer due diligence measures and monitoring on a risk-sensitive basis in any situation which presents a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. 
NatWest is to appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 14 April 2021. We will be following the case closely as it progresses.

Does this represent a change in approach by the FCA?  Can we expect to see more criminal prosecutions in the future?   We will have to wait and see if the landscape changes in favour of criminal prosecutions in certain instances.  Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that now is the time to ensure that AML compliance is a priority and that staff training is up to date.

Recent Fines by Regulators

Concerns about AML compliance failures have hit the headlines with increasing frequency in recent months.  We have seen some of the largest fines imposed over recent months by regulators.

Over the last 12 months, we have seen a number of record fines imposed by the FCA and HMRC for non-compliance with money laundering regulations. In June 2020, the FCA issued a £37.8m fine to Commerzbank London for its failures to put in place adequate AML systems and controls between October 2012 and September 2017.  Commerzbank London undertook a significant remediation exercise to bring its AML controls into compliance. The bank also conducted an extensive look-back exercise to identify suspicious transactions during the period in question.

Earlier this year, a money transfer company was handed the largest ever fine issued by HMRC of £23.8m, for ‘significant breaches’ of MLR obligations relating to risk assessments, record-keeping, policies, controls and procedures, and due diligence.

The Gambling Commission has taken similarly stringent action, issuing a fine of £13m to an entertainment business in April 2020. The penalty marked the Gambling Commission’s highest fine to date and was accompanied by strict conditions for the company to maintain its gambling license.  Neil McArthur, Chief Executive of the Gambling Commission described the failings as ‘extremely serious’.  The investigations hinged on failures to conduct enhanced due diligence. The regulator also identified failures by the business to adequately check the sources of funds in several instances.

Against this backdrop, the decision by the FCA to mount a criminal prosecution for the first time indicates a further escalation and a more robust approach towards breaches of money laundering rules.

If my business is under investigation, what should we do?

If you are currently under investigation for AML failings, the latest developments will make for uncomfortable reading.

The MLR compel those conducting regulated activity to take a risk-based and proportionate approach to their compliance obligations. The fundamental statutory obligations mandate regulated businesses to conduct a thorough risk assessment. That risk assessment should be used as the starting point to monitor customer relationships and implement a comprehensive risk and controls framework. Key compliance obligations are to ensure adequate policies and procedures are in place, that they are followed by employees, and that thorough employee training takes place. All controls implemented should be reviewed regularly and updated where appropriate.

Insufficient dedication of properly trained staff to fulfilling ongoing (and time-consuming) compliance requirements is often a feature when breaches occur. It is worth noting that, following its investigation and £37m fine from the FCA, Commerzbank London bolstered its compliance resources from three AML professionals to 50.

We know that the levels of financial crime have increased dramatically during the pandemic and therefore the systems and controls in place to target money laundering are arguably more important than ever. Changes to working practices during the pandemic have meant that many businesses have had to review their AML systems and controls. Conducting operations remotely has affected traditional customer identification and due diligence methods in some businesses. 
Regulated businesses need to review their risk assessments and compliance frameworks regularly as part of their obligations.  However, now is a good time to renew those efforts and ensure that the framework is robust.

Companies would be well advised to take advice at an early stage if potential problems are identified. If you are already under investigation for AML breaches, please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss how we can assist.

Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesBen ButlerTue 1 Mar 2022 01.08 GMTLast modified on Tue 1 Mar 2022 01.10 GMTAustrac has launched court action accusing James Packer’s Crown Resorts of breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws and continuing to contravene the law due to wholly inadequate oversight by management.In a lawsuit filed with the federal court on Tuesday, Austrac, Australia’s financial intelligence agency, said ongoing failures to properly vet risky customers – including those brought in from overseas by junket operators and locals with links to people already banned from Crown’s Melbourne and Perth casinos – accounted for 547 breaches of anti-money laundering laws.Crown Resorts agrees to $9bn takeover by BlackstoneRead moreEach alleged breach of the law if proven could attract a penalty of up to $22.2m, meaning Crown faces a fine that could theoretically exceed $12bn. However, if Austrac’s action succeeds, a far smaller penalty is likely. The current record fine is $1.3bn, which Westpac agreed to pay to settle allegations by Austrac that the bank breached AML/CTF laws more than 23m times, including by allowing a dozen customers to transfer money to the Philippines in a way consistent with child exploitation.From March 2016, just 60 high-risk customers turned over $70bn at Crown’s casinos, pumping $1.1bn in losses into the company’s coffers, Austrac said in a concise statement filed with the court.Austrac alleges that Crown failed to do appropriate due diligence on these customers, which it said included junket operators and players, foreign politically exposed people – a category that can include government officials and their families – as well as people who had been arrested for money laundering or were suspected of being “connected to organised crime”.The regulator alleges that “many engaged in large cash transactions and transacted with cash that appeared suspicious, including cash in plastic bags, shoeboxes or cardboard boxes, cash in rubber bands, small denominations of notes and counterfeit cash”.James Packer admits to ‘many oversights’ at Perth Crown casino during royal commission hearingRead moreIt alleges that an additional 447 customers engaged in transactions that Crown’s external consultants later identified as typical of money laundering or terrorism finance.Some customers allegedly engaged in multiple breaches.The legal action follows an investigation that Austrac’s chief executive, Nicole Rose, said showed that Crown failed to put in place and maintain an AML/CTF program that would mitigate the risk that its casinos were misused for money laundering.“They also failed to carry out appropriate ongoing customer due diligence including on some very high-risk customers,” she said.“This led to widespread and serious non-compliance over a number of years.“Austrac has taken this strong action to achieve enduring change and ensure that Crown will fully meet their obligations to protect themselves and Australia’s financial system from criminal activity.”She said Crown was working to improve its systems, “however there is further work to do and Austrac will continue to work closely with Crown to address ongoing compliance concerns”.Crown said it was reviewing the statement of claim filed with the court by Austrac.Crown Resorts: can a ‘special manager’ clean up Melbourne’s casino?Read moreIt said it “has developed a comprehensive remediation plan which is intended to position Crown as a leader in the industry in its approach to governance, compliance, responsible gaming and the management of financial crime risk”.“The plan is underpinned by an uplifted organisational culture.”Allegations that Crown’s casinos were being used for money laundering were made by Nine Entertainment’s newspapers and its flagship current affairs TV show, 60 Minutes, in 2019.Inquiries in both NSW and Victoria found that Crown facilitated money laundering at its Melbourne and Perth casinos and that some junket operators were linked to organised crime.

Monzo Faces FCA Investigation Into Alleged AML Contraventions

London FinTech Monzo is facing an investigation from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) over allegations of possibly violating anti-money laundering (AML) laws, Financial Times reported on Friday (July 30).
Monzo CEO TS Anil said in its most recent annual report that despite a year that posed numerous obstacles, the digital bank showed fortitude and posted a “significant amount of growth,” FT reported.
The challenger bank also used its annual report to discuss the startup’s current FCA probe regarding alleged AML violations. But the report also turned the spotlight on Monzo’s ability to keep losses at bay despite early hits from the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.
Anil said Monzo has its sights set on turning a profit next year and would raise additional funds in the coming months that will power growth and help it keep a few steps ahead of regulations regarding capital.
Monzo landed over £200 million (approximately $278 million) during its last year, while the FinTech is “fielding a significant amount of inbound interest” from new and present investors, Anil said, according to the FT report.
Although the FCA’s investigations are just getting out of the gate, the probe potentially includes both criminal and civil liability, Monzo said, per FT.
“The prevention of financial crime is an issue that affects the entire banking industry and one which Monzo is taking extremely seriously. Over the past year we have made major investments in our controls in this area as a priority and will continue to invest heavily in this part of the business,” Monzo said, per FT.
Monzo is not the only challenger bank facing scrutiny over money laundering allegations. In Germany neobank N26 was ordered by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) to step up its AML efforts. BaFin mandated that N26 Bank change how it approaches IT monitoring and customer due diligence.
