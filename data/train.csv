REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File PhotoRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterPRINCETON, N.J., April 2 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve needs to move monetary policy towards a more neutral stance, but the pace at which it tightens credit will depend on how the economy reacts, New York Fed President John Williams said Saturday.Williams, in response to questions at a symposium about whether the Fed needed to hasten its return to a neutral policy rate that neither encourages or discourages spending, noted that in 2019 with rates set near the neutral level ""the economic expansion started to slow,"" and the Fed resorted to rate cuts.""We need to get closer to neutral but we need to watch the whole way,"" Williams said. ""There is no question that is the direction we are moving. Exactly how quickly we do that depends on the circumstances.”Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterWilliams' remarks suggest a more cautious approach to coming rate increases than has been pushed by colleagues who feel the Fed should race towards a more neutral stance by using larger than usual half-point rate hikes at upcoming meetings.The median policymaker estimate of the neutral rate is 2.4%, a level that traders currently feel the central bank will hit by the end of this year. Such a pace would require half point increases at 2 of the Fed's remaining six meetings this year, with expectations of a first coming at the Fed's May 3-4 session.The Fed raised interest rates last month by a quarter of a percentage point, the beginning of what policymakers expect to be ""ongoing increases"" aimed to tame inflation currently running at triple the Fed's 2% target.At the last Fed meeting the median policymaker projected quarter-point increases only at each meeting, but several since then have said they were prepared to move more aggressively if needed.The outcome depends on whether inflation eases, Williams said.""We expect inflation to come down but if it does not….we will have to respond. My hope right now is that won't happen,” Williams said.The Fed will also be using a second tool to tighten credit when it starts to reduce the size of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Williams said that could begin as soon as May.In prepared remarks to a Princeton University symposium Williams said high inflation was currently the Fed's ""greatest challenge,"" and is potentially being driven higher by the war in Ukraine, the ongoing pandemic, and continued labor and supply shortages in the United States.""Uncertainty about the economic outlook remains extraordinarily high, and risks to the inflation outlook are particularly acute,"" Williams said.However, he said he expected the combination of rate increases and balance sheet reduction to help ease inflation to around 4% this year, and ""close to our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2024"" while keeping the economy on track.""These actions should enable us to manage the proverbial soft landing in a way that maintains a sustained strong economy and labor market,"" Williams said.

Opinion: Why gold and platinum are a window into the stock market’s future and what investors can expect

COMP

 
                    +0.95%



























The stock market’s prospects for the next 12 months are only modestly positive. That’s the conclusion of a market-timing model based on the ratio of gold’s price 
        GC00,
        +0.42%
       to platinum’s 
        PL00,
        +0.01%.
       You might think it’s good news that equities’ 12-month potential is as promising now as it was in early 2021. But, in fact, most stocks have struggled since then. A relatively small number of large-cap stocks have propelled the S&P 500 
        SPX,
        +0.25%
       higher, and the Russell 2000 index 
        RUT,
        -0.30%
       is 9.2% lower than where it stood when my early-2021 column on this gold-platinum ratio was published. The Nasdaq Composite Index 
        COMP,
        +0.95%
       is just 1.8% higher while the Russell Micro-Cap Index  is 14.7% lower. (Data, courtesy of FactSet, are through Mar. 28.)

The discovery of the gold-platinum ratio’s market-timing potential traces to a 2019 study in the Journal of Financial Economics. It showed that a rising gold-platinum ratio forecasts higher stock market returns over the subsequent 12 months, and vice versa. Entitled “Gold, Platinum and Expected Stock Returns,” its authors are Darien Huang, a former finance professor at Cornell University, and Mete Kilic, a finance professor at the University of Southern California. The chart below plots this gold-platinum ratio over the last 20 years. Notice that the ratio declined for many years prior to and including the 2008 financial crisis, correctly predicting less upside potential for the stock market. Since 2008, in contrast, the ratio has for the most part steadily risen — as has the stock market.









During the COVID pandemic of the past two years the ratio has been highly volatile: It spiked in the wake of the market’s waterfall decline in March 2020, anticipating the market’s huge potential over the subsequent 12 months. Since then it fell, rose again, and over the past couple of months has fallen back. The ratio works, according to the professors, because platinum and gold respond to different factors. While platinum primarily reflects changes in industrial demand, gold responds both to that demand as well as investors’ desire to hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainty. By focusing on the ratio of gold’s price to platinum’s, you zero in on that portion of gold’s price that is a hedge against uncertainty. Since the stock market’s expected return is compensation for uncertainty and risk, this ratio should be particularly valuable to market timers. That’s exactly what the professors found. Since 1975, the gold-platinum ratio has had a significantly better track record predicting the market’s subsequent 12-month return than nine other well-known indicators that other researchers previously found to have predictive ability — including, prominently, the Cyclically-Adjusted PE Ratio, or CAPE, made famous by Yale University (and Nobel laureate) Robert Shiller.The ‘war puzzle‘ You might find it surprising that the gold-platinum ratio has fallen in recent months, which suggests that risk has declined. Yet in February Russia invaded Ukraine and, according to some, the conflict could lead to World War III. That certainly seems like the very definition of heightened risk. In fact, however, the gold-platinum ratio’s decline in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is not that unexpected. In academic circles it’s been known for some time that the stock market tends to experience below-average volatility during wars and military conflicts — a pattern known as the “war puzzle.” According to a study that the National Bureau of Economic Research began circulating a couple of weeks ago, stock market volatility has been “33 percent lower during major wars and periods of conflict since 1921.” The study, “Stock Volatility and the War Puzzle,” was conducted by Gustavo Cortes, a finance professor at the University of Florida; Angela Vossmeyer, an economics professor at Claremont McKenna College, and Marc Weidenmier, a research associate at Chapman College. They at least partially solved the puzzle, finding that increased defense spending during wars and military conflicts leads corporate profits to become more predictable. That in turn translates to lower stock market volatility and risk. Regardless of whether this solves the “war puzzle,” the message of the gold-platinum based indicator with a good market-timing record is that the stock market’s potential over the next 12 months is only moderately positive.

Danske Bank Secures a Big Victory in Investor Suit Based on Alleged AML Violations


By Izabella Babchinetskaya on September 9, 2021
Posted in Civil Liability to Private Parties, Investor Suits




Copenhagen, Denmark
Danske Bank (Danske) recently secured a big victory in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  On August 25, 2021, the appellate court unanimously affirmed the Southern District of New York’s dismissal of an investor lawsuit brought by purchasers of DB American Depository Receipts (ADR) against Danske and its former officers and board members over alleged misrepresentations about Danske’s financial condition.  We previously blogged about the lower court’s decision here.  As we have blogged about here, here, here, and here, Danske Bank has been the subject of significant regulatory oversight due to its alleged AML failures of historical proportions, which has resulted in a foreseeable onslaught of investor lawsuits.
Although much of the Second Circuit’s opinion is focused on timing issues relevant to almost any investor lawsuit based on material misstatements and omissions, portions of the opinion are particularly relevant to investor claims resting on alleged AML failures and money laundering by financial institution customers.  Importantly, neither knowledge of potential misconduct by customers gained by an institution from either its AML-related monitoring or whistleblower reporting, nor generalized claims to investors by an institution of robust AML compliance, will – standing alone – result in liability.
As a recap, the class action sought relief for Danske’s alleged failure to follow AML protocols in regards to its Estonian Branch—a scandal that first surfaced in 2016, eventually shedding light on approximately $230 billion in alleged suspicious transactions.  The lawsuit alleged that Danske failed to supervise the Estonian Branch, responded poorly to AML issues, and made several misstatements and omissions.  Among several claims, the plaintiffs brought suit under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, as enforced by Rule 10b-5.  The appeal focused on the first element required under the provision—the existence of a material misrepresentation, misstatement, or omission.
The plaintiffs alleged five categories of misstatements and omissions.  In affirming the lower court’s decision, the appellate court held that none of the alleged misstatements or omissions were actionable—“the allegations [did] not move the claims outside of the realm of corporate mismanagement and into the realm of securities fraud.”  The five at-issue categories and the court’s reasoning as to why they were not actionable are listed below.

Financial Statements. The plaintiffs argued that Danske’s 2013 to 2015 financial statements included revenue from the illegal transactions without a disclosure of possible money laundering activity.  The court, however, emphasized that financial disclosures are not automatically misleading “by virtue of the company’s nondisclosure of suspected misconduct that may have contributed to the financial results.” The court stressed that an alleged failure to disclose in financial statements “uncharged, unadjudicated wrongdoing” generally cannot form the basis for a viable misstatement theory.  This finding is potentially quite helpful and important for financial institutions in regards to investor lawsuits based on alleged AML violations – because, almost invariably, a financial institution’s AML compliance program will identify, and therefore put the institution “on notice,” of potential misconduct (and uncharged) by customers.  Indeed, that is one of the main goals – if not the main goal – of maintaining an AML compliance program.

The court also rejected a related argument that Danske’s financial reports were per se misleading because of alleged noncompliance with standards promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board – specifically, because Danske purportedly “violated those standards by including revenue derived from unenforceable [deposit] contracts” with clients using the Estonian branch to launder money.  However, whether the contracts were actually unenforceable turned on foreign contract law, and the plaintiffs failed to identify any law or contract provision rendering the contracts unenforceable.

Goodwill Impairment. The plaintiffs claimed that it was misleading for Danske in 2014 to characterize its goodwill impairment write-down as a “technical” accounting matter when the impairment was really a consequence of Danske’s decision to eliminate its Non-Resident Portfolio (NRP) that was the source of the suspicious activity.  The court disagreed, stating that “materiality can have a half-life.”  Because of the passage of time between the statement and the purchase of shares and the scrutiny Danske faced for its AML noncompliance, the goodwill statements “were too remote in time to have ‘assumed actual significance.’”
Whistleblower Comment. Danske’s 2015 statement regarding a new whistleblower reporting system was purportedly materially misleading by omission, because “Danske misled investors by touting its new anonymous whistleblower system while failing to simultaneously discuss the issues raised” by the whistleblower who had emailed Danske executives directly about his concerns regarding money laundering in the Estonian branch.  Significantly, like the goodwill statements, the whistleblower comment was made three years before the plaintiffs purchased any ADRs, which significantly diminished this statement’s impact on investors in 2018.  This timing issue doomed the claim, even if Danske’s statement and alleged omission was assumed to be misleading.
Corporate Responsibility Statements. The plaintiffs claimed that corporate governance statements related to Danske’s AML compliance were misleading.  The court held that the general statements about the importance of acting lawfully and with integrity were mere puffery, not actionable, and not likely to have impacted investors three years after the AML scandal surfaced. More specifically, statements by Danske that it complied with internationally-recognized Know Your Customer procedures and customer due diligence standards were insufficiently detailed and specific to support a claim.  Likewise, “[a]lthough Danske averred that it took steps to comply with AML protocols and vaguely recited some AML buzzwords, it claims no particular acts of compliance.”  Therefore, no reasonable investor – particularly one who purchased the ADRs years after the “gigantic” AML scandal at Danske had surfaced – would rely on such statements when investing.
2018 Contingencies Footnote. Finally, plaintiffs asserted that Danske’s statement that it did not expect the scandal to materially impact its financial position was misleading because Danske knew that the scope of the scandal exceeded what had been reported.  The plaintiffs, however, purchased the ADRs about three weeks before this statement was made; therefore, the statement could not have influenced the price of a purchase that plaintiffs already made.

All in all, this decision is a positive result for financial institutions, as it provides several key takeaways for what a court considers to be actionable misrepresentations and omissions in the context of alleged AML violations – even in the specific context of the greatest AML scandal to date, at least in regards to sheer volume and monetary value of the alleged suspicious transactions.

31st Jan 2022
The biggest fraud and money laundering cases




 





Share





 



Money laundering and fraud can have a severe impact on everyone from regular citizens to multinational corporations. In fact, the National Crime Agency puts the cost of money laundering and fraud to British businesses, citizens and government at over £190 billion a year[1].As you might expect, there have been some extraordinary examples of these crimes over the years. We have analysed 10 of the most lucrative (and shocking!) cases, to reveal exactly what happened and how businesses and individuals can learn from these cases moving into 2020:1.	‘Mr Big’ After serving a three-year prison sentence for laundering drug money[2], Maythem Al-Ansari, aka ‘Mr Big’, was staring down the barrel of an additional jail term for a mortgage fraud that cost millions of pounds. However, after handing over his passport as part of the bail terms, an error allowed Al-Ansari to acquire another passport from the Home Office, which he used to flee to Syria. Eventually Mr Big gave himself up at London Heathrow in 2016, but the blunder was highly embarrassing at the time and left millions of pounds unaccounted for. Of course, this was a high profile case and this kind of error rarely occurs, but it highlights the necessity of government bodies to continue working closely together to avoid lapses in communication that allow such issues to happen. 2.	Largest ever visa fraud in the UKFour people were sentenced in September 2019 at Southwark Crown Court[3] for being behind the UK’s largest ever visa and immigration fraud case. The culprits impersonated ‘immigration advisors’ who charged extortionate fees for compiling (false) immigration applications that would’ve cost millions of pounds to the British taxpayer had the scam come off. It’s imperative that those looking to migrate to the United Kingdom only go through the proper, official channels to avoid any chance of being defrauded. 3.	Failings at Standard Chartered Bank For a vast series of failings including opening a bank account with 3 million UAE Dirham (£500,000) deposited from cash in a suitcase, the Financial Conduct Authority issued its second-largest fine[4] to Standard Chartered Bank in April 2019 of just over £102 million.Businesses, particularly those in the banking and financial sector, must take an active approach in identifying money laundering risks and reporting these without hesitation to the relevant authorities. Complying with money laundering legislation will save companies money in the long run as any fines for breaches would eclipse resulting fines. 4.	The worst female fraudster in the UKAptly dubbed by police as the “UK’s most prolific female fraudster”[5], Maria Michaela scammed banks out of £13 million by submitting offers on houses over the market value and then defaulting on the mortgages. Michaela was able to repeat this several times by using false identities.This highlights how important it is that mortgage lenders take a close, critical look at offers that come in well over the asking price. Many offers of this nature will be genuine, but sometimes they are too good to be true. 5.	Luxury accessories, 500 lottery tickets and even bars of gold Police tracked a series of dubious purchases by Stephen Burton, before raiding his home in February 2019[6], uncovering a vast collection of possessions with a value of almost £1 million. These included solid gold bars, designer watches, thousands of pounds and euros, 500 lottery tickets and false identities. Police were able to ‘follow the money’ in this case, as purchases that are beyond the means of ‘average citizens’ are often indicators that fraudulent behaviour is taking place. 6.	Suitcase smugglingIn November 2019[7], police arrested ten suspected members of an organised crime gang, under suspicion of smuggling £15.5 million pounds out of the UK to Dubai in suitcases. 

This is another example of the authorities building a case around suspected illegal activity, in this instance unusual travel patterns and living well above one’s means, and acting upon their investigations. 7.	Big-time benefit fraud Following the death of her father in 2004, Ethel McGill[8] continued to claim his war pension and benefits by claiming he was still alive, at one point convincing a friend to lay down under a blanket to impersonate Mr Dennison.  McGill also faked disability and dementia for over two decades but investigators at the Department for Work and Pensions acquired videos of her driving and moving around, despite her claims of needing a wheelchair. Everyday people are often able to help in cases like this, so if you know about a fraudulent situation then reporting it to the relevant authorities can really help. 8.	Bank of Scotland’s scandalHundreds of people were left in serious financial difficulty due to rogue employees at Bank of Scotland’s (HBOS) Reading branch colluding with consultants to defraud small businesses of around £245 million between 2003 and 2007[9].The scam involved referring small businesses to a ‘turnaround consultancy’, which would convince the businesses they needed help, before loading them with astronomical debts and fees. For failing to disclose information about the activity, HBOS was fined over £45 million.Small businesses should always proceed with caution when being passed over to outside consultancies without seeking their own, independent advice. 9.	Four cases and lots of cash In 2019 Mohamed Imran Khan Sathar Khan, then 36, was caught by Border Force operatives trying to smuggle £1.5 million in four suitcases to Dubai[10]. Each case weighed exactly 20kg, which savvy border guards were able to recognise as suspicious before searching the cases and rumbling the fraudster.This is a great example of authorities spotting a strange pattern and acting on their suspicions. With such situations, it is always better to be safe than sorry.  10.	Huge fine for Commonwealth Bank In 2018 Australia’s largest lender, Commonwealth Bank, agreed to pay a whopping £400 million fine[11], the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history, for breach of anti money laundering and counter-terror financing legislation. In total, there were 53,000 suspicious transactions that weren’t reported to the relevant authorities by the bank. According to Commonwealth, this was due to a coding error preventing the automatic reporting of transactions that may be indicative of illegal activity. Companies in the financial and banking sectors should continually monitor and proactively troubleshoot their software to ensure it is recording data and reporting accurately and efficiently, or else risk being faced with huge fines and repercussions.Here we have picked out just ten of the most high-profile examples of money laundering and fraud, but these are the tip of the iceberg. These cases are continuously occurring and those that are on a smaller scale most likely won’t make the news. The size of the problem is enormous, costing British citizens, businesses and government hundreds of billions of pounds each year. Looking at prominent cases does serve a purpose in that it highlights the issue and can raise awareness of money laundering and fraud, and may help businesses understand how to better protect themselves against such crimes. To find out more on how SmartSearch can help your business, please visit: https://www.smartsearch.com/product/overviewReferences: [1]https://nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/national-economic-crime-centre-leads-push-to-identify-money-laundering-activity[2]https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/criminal-mr-big-on-run-with-10m-after-disastrous-passport-blunder-8209073.html [3]https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/four-sentenced-their-part-uks-largest-ever-visa-fraud

Austrac launches civil proceedings over alleged AML failings at Crown

1st March 2022
 | By Robert Fletcher
			

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac), a government-operated national financial intelligence agency, has commenced civil penalty proceedings against Crown Resorts over allegations of “serious and systemic” anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) failings.

Legal action follows compliance work with the casino sector, which Austrac said led to a number of detailed enforcement investigations including into compliance of the Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth properties.
Austrac’s allegations include that the two properties failed to appropriately assess the money laundering and terrorism financing risks they faced, including the likelihood and impact of those risks, and to identify and respond to changes in risk over time.
Crown Melbourne and Crown Perth were also found to have not included in their AML/CTF programs appropriate risk-based systems and controls to mitigate and manage the risks to Crown.
Austrac also said the properties did not establish an appropriate framework for board and senior management oversight of the AML/CTF programs, nor did they have a transaction monitoring program to help identify suspicious activity that was risk-based or appropriate to the nature, size and complexity of Crown.
Other alleged failings included that the properties did not have an appropriate enhanced customer due diligence program to carry out additional checks on higher risk customers, nor did they conduct appropriate ongoing customer due diligence on a players who presented higher money laundering risks.
“Austrac’s investigation identified poor governance, risk management and failures to have and maintain a compliant AML/CTF program detailing how Crown would identify, mitigate and manage the risk of their products and services being misused for money laundering or terrorism financing,” Austrac chief executive Nicole Rose said.
“They also failed to carry out appropriate ongoing customer due diligence including on some very high-risk customers. This led to widespread and serious non-compliance over a number of years..
“Austrac has taken this strong action to achieve enduring change and ensure that Crown will fully meet their obligations to protect themselves and Australia’s financial system from criminal activity.”
Rose also said the absence of appropriate controls and processes meant Crown was unable to appropriately manage high risk customers, which in turn allowed the movement of money in non-transparent ways, making Crown vulnerable to criminal exploitation.
“This is an important reminder to all casinos in Australia that they must have a strong anti-money laundering program in place to protect their business and the community from serious and organised crime,” Rose said.
Austrac said it would not provide further comment on the action or details provided in the court documents now the matter is before the court, adding that whether a civil penalty order is made, and what this could amount, are matters for the court.
Responding to the case, Crown said it had developed a comprehensive remediation plan intended to position the group as a “leader” in the industry in its approach to governance, compliance, responsible gaming and the management of financial crime risk.
These actions included establishing a comprehensive Financial Crime & Compliance Change Program and implementing new controls to manage the risk of financial crime, including a revised Joint AML/CTF program.
Other activity included introducing improved controls to prevent and detect money laundering through Crown’s bank accounts and reduced limits for cash deposits at its casinos, as well as increasing its Financial Crime and Compliance resourcing and capability.
Crown also noted it had invested in automation, specifically a new automated transaction monitoring system and digitised tool to allow electronic submission and investigation of unusual activity reports, while a forensic audit and controls assessment of Crown’s patron bank accounts was carried out by an independent consultant.
“The plan is underpinned by an uplifted organisational culture,” Crown said. “Crown recognises the importance of complying with its financial crime obligations and has overhauled its approach to managing financial crime risk.”
Rose acknowledged these efforts, saying: “Crown is taking steps towards improving its systems, processes and resourcing however there is further work to do and Austrac will continue to work closely with Crown to address ongoing compliance concerns.”
Crown has faced a number of regulatory issues in recent times. In October last year, Crown was found to be “unsuitable” to operate Crown Melbourne in in Victoria following an investigation by the state’s Royal Commission. 
Crown did not lose its licence, due to the potential economic repercussions for Victoria, but was ordered to adhere to special measures, including 33 recommendations made by the Commission.
This investigation came as a result of the Bergin Inquiry in New South Wales, which was launched in August 2019. 
The inquiry assessed Crown’s eligibility to receive a casino licence in Sydney, ultimately deeming it “unsuitable”. However, it said it may still be permitted to operate the casino following implementation of its reforms.
Meanwhile, Austrac said that enforcement investigations into SkyCity Adelaide and the Star Entertainment, announced in June of last year, continue. Star and SkyCity, along with Crown, received notice of the allegations, while the National Bank of Australia (NAB) was also contacted by Austrac.
At the time, Austrac said the matter was related to “serious non-compliance” with the Australian Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Rules Instrument 2007 (AML/CTF Rules).

REUTERS/Arnd WIegmannRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterZURICH, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Credit Suisse faced charges in a Swiss court on Monday of allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros, some of it stuffed into suitcases.In the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland, Swiss prosecutors are seeking around 42.4 million Swiss francs ($45.86 million) in compensation from Credit Suisse (CSGN.S).They say the country's second-biggest bank and one of its former relationship managers did not take all necessary steps to prevent the alleged drug traffickers from hiding and laundering cash between 2004 and 2008.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegister""Credit Suisse unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it and is convinced that its former employee is innocent,"" the bank said in a statement to Reuters. It added it would ""defend itself vigorously in court"".The case has attracted intense interest in Switzerland, where it is seen as a test for prosecutors taking a potentially tougher stance against the country's banks.The indictment runs to more than 500 pages, and centres on relationships that Credit Suisse and its ex-employee had with former Bulgarian wrestler Evelin Banev and multiple associates, two of whom are charged in the case. A second indictment in the case charges a former relationship manager at Julius Baer with facilitating money laundering.A legal representative for the ex-Credit Suisse employee, who cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, said the case was unjustified and his client denied wrongdoing.That banker would start testifying on Wednesday or Thursday, a preliminary court schedule showed.A lawyer for the two alleged gang members, who face charges of multiple counts of misappropriation, fraud and forgery of documents in the Swiss federal court but cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, declined to comment. A lawyer for the former relationship manager at Julius Baer did not respond to requests for comment.Banev, who does not face charges in Switzerland, was convicted of drug trafficking in Italy in 2017 and then in Bulgaria in 2018 for money laundering.He vanished, but was arrested in September in Ukraine.Bulgarian prosecutors are seeking his extradition to face charges of setting up an organised criminal group for money laundering, while Romania seeks him for setting up a group for drug trafficking, Interpol's red list of wanted persons shows.Banev's legal representative had no immediate comment.Julius Baer (BAER.S), which is not facing charges, declined to comment on the case.CASH IN CASESThe former Credit Suisse employee brought at least one Bulgarian customer, who was an associate of Banev, with her when she joined Credit Suisse in 2004, prosecutors allege in the indictment.The customer, who was later shot dead as he left a restaurant with his wife in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2005, had begun placing suitcases full of cash in a safe deposit box at Credit Suisse, the indictment says.Prosecutors allege the gang used a practice known as smurfing, whereby a large sum of money is broken down into smaller amounts that are below the anti-money laundering alert threshold, to launder money, putting millions of euros in small-value bills into safety deposit boxes and later transferring them into accounts.The defendants said this was standard practice at the time the deposits were made, although Swiss private banks have since adopted much tougher anti-money laundering know-your-client checks after international pressure.The prosecutors allege the former relationship manager, who left Credit Suisse in 2010 after being detained for two weeks by police in 2009, helped conceal the criminal origins of money for the clients by carrying out more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions, including 43 million francs in cash.""Our client is being unfairly accused, because Swiss law requires that a person be implicated in order to condemn a bank,"" attorneys at law firm MANGEAT LLC, representing the ex-employee, told Reuters. ""She is innocent, outraged by the accusations. We will plead for her full and complete acquittal.""Credit Suisse disputes the illegal origin of the money, a source familiar with its thinking told Reuters, saying that Banev and his circle operated legitimate businesses in construction, leasing and hotels.The Swiss bank, which the indictment says considered Bulgaria as a high-risk country at the time, plans to draw attention to calls made by its compliance department to Swiss prosecutors after Banev was temporarily arrested in Bulgaria in April 2007, the source added.Credit Suisse is hoping that the court will view that its compliance department's move was a sign of the bank taking its anti-money laundering obligations seriously and of cooperating with prosecutors in the matter.In June 2007, the prosecutors asked Credit Suisse for information on accounts held by Banev and his associates in response to a request from Bulgaria, the source added.Noticing a series of withdrawals, the bank's compliance department asked prosecutors whether to freeze the accounts, but was told not to in order to avoid tipping the clients off, according to the source.By the time prosecutors gave Credit Suisse the go-ahead, much of the money had been withdrawn.The prosecutors' office declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was in the hands of the court.The second indictment filed by federal prosecutors against the former relationship manager at Julius Baer, which is being tried in the same court case, alleges some of the funds were transferred to another Swiss bank.The former relationship manager, who left a few months after the transfers took place, is charged with facilitating money laundering.Julius Baer had refused to accept a suitcase filled with cash from the defendants, the indictment says.($1 = 0.9245 Swiss francs)Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comRegisterReporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Silke Koltrowitz; Additional reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova; Editing by Alexander Smith and Barbara LewisOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Global InvestorSign up to our investor newsletter to get the latest news and trends in global financial markets.Sign upDaily BriefingSubscribe to our newsletter to get all the news you need to start your day.Sign upSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout ReutersCareersReuters News AgencyBrand Attribution GuidelinesReuters LeadershipReuters Fact CheckReuters Diversity ReportStay InformedDownload the AppNewslettersInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

	Pradip Shah, who had taken charge as the chairman of National Asset Reconstruction Co Ltd (NARCL), stepped down before the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could approve the proposal, State Bank of India (SBI) said.

	Shah, a financial sector veteran, took charge of the NARCL soon after the debt recast firm received the licence from the RBI.

	According to sources familiar to the development, NARCL sought the RBI’s approval for appointing four directors. The application also indicated Shah's role as the chairman of the board.

	“Directors’ appointment is one among the many appro­vals that an ARC requires prior to commencing business,” SBI said in a statement.

	NARCL has been set up by banks to aggregate and consolidate stressed assets for their subsequent resolution. SBI, along with other public sector banks will have 51 per cent stake in NARCL, the government had said.

	“While these requests were under process, Mr Pradip Shah stepped down from the NARCL Board. The RBI approval, therefore, was received only for the remaining directors. The factual position is that Mr Pradip Shah happened to step down prior to receipt of the RBI approval,” the statement said.

	Sources said the RBI approval for the four candidates were sought on January 21, 2022. Shah stepped down from the post on January 28.

	“RBI wanted some more time, some more background check was required,” said a source, requesting anonymity.

	“The standard process for onboarding of directors for an ARC is to seek prior approval of the RBI. In view of the urgency to operationalise NARCL quickly, soon after receipt of RBI licence, a few directors, including Mr Pradip Shah, were onboarded and an application was submitted to RBI for approval,” the SBI said.

	After Shah stepped down, Subrata Biswas, a deputy managing director of SBI and one of the nominee directors of NARCL, was appointed as interim chairman.

	Sources said that NARCL will seek fresh approval from RBI for appointing the chairman. One director’s post in the NARCL board is still vacant.

In this articleCSG.N-CHA sign above the entrance to the Credit Suisse Group AG headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, on Monday, Nov. 1, 2021.Thi My Lien Nguyen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCredit Suisse will face charges in a Swiss court on Monday of allowing an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang to launder millions of euros, some of it stuffed into suitcases.Swiss prosecutors say the country's second-biggest bank and one of its former relationship managers did not take all necessary steps to prevent the alleged drug traffickers from hiding and laundering cash between 2004 and 2008.""Credit Suisse unreservedly rejects as meritless all allegations in this legacy matter raised against it and is convinced that its former employee is innocent,"" the bank said in a statement to Reuters.In the first criminal trial of a major bank in Switzerland, prosecutors are seeking around 42.4 million Swiss francs in compensation from Credit Suisse, which added that it would ""defend itself vigorously in court"".The case has attracted intense interest in Switzerland, where it is seen as a test for a potentially tougher stance by prosecutors against the country's banks. The indictment runs to more than 500 pages, and centers on relationships that Credit Suisse and its ex-employee had with former Bulgarian wrestler Evelin Banev and multiple associates, two of whom are charged in the case. A second indictment in the case charges a former relationship manager at Julius Baer with facilitating money laundering.A legal representative for the ex-Credit Suisse employee, who cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, said the case was unjustified and his client denied wrongdoing.A lawyer for the two alleged gang members, who face charges of multiple counts of misappropriation, fraud and forgery of documents in the Swiss federal court but cannot be named under Swiss privacy laws, declined to comment. A lawyer for the former relationship manager at Julius Baer did not respond to requests for comment. VIDEO10:3210:32What's happened to Swiss banks?CNBC ExplainsBanev, who does not face charges in Switzerland, was convicted of drug trafficking in Italy in 2017 and then in Bulgaria in 2018 for being part of a criminal organization active in trafficking tones of cocaine from Latin America. He vanished, but was arrested in September in Ukraine, from where Bulgarian prosecutors are seeking his extradition to face charges of setting up an organized criminal group and drug trafficking, Interpol's red list of wanted persons shows.Banev and his legal representatives could not be reached for comment. A lawyer who represented Banev in his Bulgarian trial said she was no longer representing him. Julius Baer, which is not facing charges, declined to comment on the case.   Cash in casesThe former Credit Suisse employee brought at least one Bulgarian customer who was an associate of Banev with her when she joined Credit Suisse in 2004, prosecutors allege in the indictment.VIDEO4:3504:35Credit Suisse 'a great franchise' despite legacy issues, strategist saysSquawk Box EuropeThe customer, who was later shot dead as he left a restaurant with his wife in Sofia, Bulgaria in 2005, had begun placing suitcases full of cash in a safe deposit box at Credit Suisse, the indictment says. Prosecutors allege the gang used so-called smurfing, where a large sum of money is broken down into smaller amounts which are below the anti-money laundering alert threshold, to launder money, putting millions of euros in small-value bills into safety deposit boxes and later transferring them into accounts. Although Swiss private banks have since adopted much tougher anti-money laundering so-called know-your-client checks after international pressure, the defendants said this was standard practice at the time the deposits were made.The prosecutors allege the former relationship manager, who left Credit Suisse in 2010 after being detained for two weeks by police in 2009, helped conceal the criminal origins of money for the clients by carrying out more than 146 million Swiss francs in transactions, including 43 million francs in cash. ""Our client is being unfairly accused, because Swiss law requires that a person be implicated in order to condemn a bank,"" attorneys at law firm MANGEAT LLC, representing the ex-employee, told Reuters. ""She is innocent, outraged by the accusations. We will plead for her full and complete acquittal.""VIDEO4:3004:30Accident like Archegos must not happen again, Credit Suisse CEO saysSquawk Box EuropeCredit Suisse disputes the illegal origin of the money, a source familiar with its thinking told Reuters, saying that Banev and his circle operated legitimate businesses in construction, leasing and hotels.The Swiss bank, which the indictment says considered Bulgaria as a high-risk country at the time, plans to draw attention to calls made by its compliance department to Swiss prosecutors after Banev was temporarily arrested in Bulgaria in April 2007, the source added.Credit Suisse is hoping that the court will view that its compliance department's move was a sign of the bank taking its anti-money laundering obligations seriously and of cooperating with prosecutors in the matter.In June 2007, the prosecutors asked Credit Suisse for information on accounts held by Banev and his associates in response to a request from Bulgaria, the source added.Noticing a series of withdrawals, the bank's compliance department asked prosecutors whether to freeze the accounts, but were told not to do so in order not to tip the clients off, according to the source. VIDEO3:1903:19There needs to be more disclosure by family offices: Vanity Fair's William CohanSquawk on the StreetBy the time prosecutors gave Credit Suisse the go-ahead, much of the money had been withdrawn.The prosecutors' office declined to comment on Friday, saying the matter was now in the hands of the court.The second indictment filed by federal prosecutors against the former relationship manager at Julius Baer, which is being tried in the same court case, alleges some of the funds were transferred to another Swiss bank.The former relationship manager, who left a few months after the transfers took place, is charged with facilitating money laundering.The bank had refused to accept a suitcase filled with cash from the defendants, the indictment says.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Friday, April 1, 2022 
Man Sentenced to 46 Months in Prison for Firearm Offenses
An Alabama man was sentenced today to 46 months in prison for federal and local firearms offenses stemming from the discovery of weapons in his pickup truck parked near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
Lonnie Leroy Coffman, 72, of Falkville, Alabama, was sentenced today to 46 months in prison after pleading guilty to federal and local firearms offenses stemming from the discovery of weapons in his pickup truck parked near the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
According to court documents, Coffman traveled from Alabama to the District of Columbia several days prior to Jan. 6, 2021. He parked his red GMC Sierra pickup truck in the 300 block of First Street SE, on the morning of Jan. 6. Less than half a mile away in the U.S. Capitol Building, a joint session of the U.S. Congress was scheduled to meet in the afternoon to ascertain and count the electoral votes related to the presidential election.
Coffman admitted in his plea agreement that he exited the pickup truck at 9:20 a.m. and walked in the direction of the U.S. Capitol Building, and towards a rally near the National Mall. Inside the pickup truck were several loaded firearms within arms-reach of the driver’s seat, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, a crossbow with bolts, machetes, camouflage smoke devices, a stun gun, and a cooler containing 11 mason jars filled with ignitable ingredients for Molotov cocktail incendiary weapons. Coffman also carried a loaded handgun and a loaded revolver as he walked around the area that day. A search of Coffman’s residence in Alabama later that month led to the discovery of 12 additional mason jars containing ignitable substances, each constituting the component parts of Molotov cocktails.
Coffman did not have a license to carry a pistol in the District of Columbia and had not registered any firearms or destructive devices in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, as required by law.
Coffman has been in custody since his arrest on Jan. 6, 2021. Coffman will be placed on three years of supervised release following his prison term.
Coffman was sentenced in the District of Columbia by the Honorable Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in two separate criminal cases, one brought in the District of Columbia on Jan. 7, 2021, and the other brought in the Northern District of Alabama and transferred to the District of Columbia for purposes of plea and sentencing. Coffman had pleaded guilty on Nov. 12, 2021, to two counts of possession of an unregistered firearm, a federal offense, regarding the component parts of Molotov cocktails discovered in his pickup truck in Washington, D.C., and at his residence in Alabama. Coffman also pleaded guilty to carrying a pistol without a license, a District of Columbia offense. Judge Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him to 46 months in prison on each of the federal offenses, and 15 months on the District of Columbia offense, with the time running concurrently.
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Friedman for the District of Columbia and Henry Cornelius for the Northern District of Alabama prosecuted the case, with valuable assistance provided by Trial Attorney Taryn Meeks of the National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section.
The case was investigated by the FBI’s Birmingham and Washington Field Offices, and the U.S. Capitol Police.

Money Laundering
AML expert sentenced in money laundering case2021-08-02T15:48:00+01:00











 














No comments








The former chairman of an industry group who provided anti-money laundering advice and training to lawmakers and financial regulators has been sentenced for offences related to money laundering.Dominic Thorncroft faced one charge of failing to alert the authorities to money laundering, one of breaching money laundering regulations and four charges of retaining a wrongful credit.
Thorncroft, former chairman of the Association of UK Payment Institutions, was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, by a crown court in London. He was also ordered to do 250 hours of unpaid work.
Specialist prosecutor Stephane Pendered said: “Dominic Thorncroft did not commit the fraud himself. However, his actions have allowed £850,000 defrauded from 60 individuals to be dispersed across the world.” The sum equates to $1.18m or €995,000.
She added: “Thorncroft promoted himself as an anti-money laundering expert but failed to live up to the standards he set for others, so when his business was clearly being used to launder criminal property, he failed to follow his own advice and report what was happening to the authorities.”
According to Britain’s CPS prosecution service an investigation by London-based Metropolitan Police began in 2016 found evidence linking Thorncroft to an investment fraud which took place in 2014. He had allowed his Money Service Bureau business to be used by the fraudsters to transfer money to Hong Kong and China.
The CPS and the police were able to prove that Thorncroft should have known or suspected that the money passing through his business’s bank accounts was criminal property, the CPS said
“Despite his substantial knowledge and expertise of money laundering, Thorncroft failed to alert the authorities to the suspicious activity and allowed it to continue,” it added.
Thorncroft’s legal representative Kevin Baumber told the court his offending was “characterised by incompetence not deliberation” and he did not have “a guilty mind or sinister motives”, the Financial Times reported.
The presiding judge said it should have been obvious to him that his company was being used to launder money even though the fraud had been sophisticated and well executed. Thorncroft did not benefit financially from the offences, he added.

The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) has launched its first criminal prosecution for offences under the Money Laundering Regulations. It is also the first criminal prosecution against a bank for such offences. Previous FCA action has focussed on imposing fines for breaches and regulatory action over criminal prosecution.  However, they have been heavily criticised previously for failing to prosecute breaches. Does this case signal a new regulatory approach?




NatWest Bank is alleged to have accepted cash deposits of £264m without adequately monitoring and scrutinising the suspicious transaction behaviour. Following a four-year long investigation by the FCA, the bank has found itself before the Magistrates’ Court to defend itself against criminal failings to adhere to the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 (“MLR”).  However, it is interesting to note that there are no individuals charged with any offences.  The penalties will therefore be financial in nature and will not result in a custodial sentence or criminal conviction for any individual.  The reputational damage, however, is likely to be significant for the bank as the case will be closely monitored as it the first time a bank has faced a criminal prosecution of this nature.

The FCA allege that NatWest failed in its obligation to conduct and demonstrate risk sensitive due diligence and ongoing monitoring of its relationships with its customers for the purposes of preventing money laundering. The issues arise from an account owned by a UK incorporated customer.  It is alleged that around £365 million was paid into the customer’s account, with £264 million paid in cash. NatWest’s handling of those deposits is said to have failed to adhere to the requirements of regulations 8(1), 8(3) and 14(1) of the MLR.

Regulations 8(1) and 8(3) MLR require a relevant person to conduct ongoing monitoring of a business relationship, including keeping up-to-date documents, data or information obtained for the purpose of applying customer due diligence measures. The regulations also provide for the ongoing monitoring of customer due diligence.

Regulation 14(1) MLR relates to enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring.  A relevant person is required to apply enhanced customer due diligence measures and monitoring on a risk-sensitive basis in any situation which presents a higher risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. 
NatWest is to appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 14 April 2021. We will be following the case closely as it progresses.

Does this represent a change in approach by the FCA?  Can we expect to see more criminal prosecutions in the future?   We will have to wait and see if the landscape changes in favour of criminal prosecutions in certain instances.  Regardless of the outcome, it is clear that now is the time to ensure that AML compliance is a priority and that staff training is up to date.

Recent Fines by Regulators

Concerns about AML compliance failures have hit the headlines with increasing frequency in recent months.  We have seen some of the largest fines imposed over recent months by regulators.

Over the last 12 months, we have seen a number of record fines imposed by the FCA and HMRC for non-compliance with money laundering regulations. In June 2020, the FCA issued a £37.8m fine to Commerzbank London for its failures to put in place adequate AML systems and controls between October 2012 and September 2017.  Commerzbank London undertook a significant remediation exercise to bring its AML controls into compliance. The bank also conducted an extensive look-back exercise to identify suspicious transactions during the period in question.

Earlier this year, a money transfer company was handed the largest ever fine issued by HMRC of £23.8m, for ‘significant breaches’ of MLR obligations relating to risk assessments, record-keeping, policies, controls and procedures, and due diligence.

The Gambling Commission has taken similarly stringent action, issuing a fine of £13m to an entertainment business in April 2020. The penalty marked the Gambling Commission’s highest fine to date and was accompanied by strict conditions for the company to maintain its gambling license.  Neil McArthur, Chief Executive of the Gambling Commission described the failings as ‘extremely serious’.  The investigations hinged on failures to conduct enhanced due diligence. The regulator also identified failures by the business to adequately check the sources of funds in several instances.

Against this backdrop, the decision by the FCA to mount a criminal prosecution for the first time indicates a further escalation and a more robust approach towards breaches of money laundering rules.

If my business is under investigation, what should we do?

If you are currently under investigation for AML failings, the latest developments will make for uncomfortable reading.

The MLR compel those conducting regulated activity to take a risk-based and proportionate approach to their compliance obligations. The fundamental statutory obligations mandate regulated businesses to conduct a thorough risk assessment. That risk assessment should be used as the starting point to monitor customer relationships and implement a comprehensive risk and controls framework. Key compliance obligations are to ensure adequate policies and procedures are in place, that they are followed by employees, and that thorough employee training takes place. All controls implemented should be reviewed regularly and updated where appropriate.

Insufficient dedication of properly trained staff to fulfilling ongoing (and time-consuming) compliance requirements is often a feature when breaches occur. It is worth noting that, following its investigation and £37m fine from the FCA, Commerzbank London bolstered its compliance resources from three AML professionals to 50.

We know that the levels of financial crime have increased dramatically during the pandemic and therefore the systems and controls in place to target money laundering are arguably more important than ever. Changes to working practices during the pandemic have meant that many businesses have had to review their AML systems and controls. Conducting operations remotely has affected traditional customer identification and due diligence methods in some businesses. 
Regulated businesses need to review their risk assessments and compliance frameworks regularly as part of their obligations.  However, now is a good time to renew those efforts and ensure that the framework is robust.

Companies would be well advised to take advice at an early stage if potential problems are identified. If you are already under investigation for AML breaches, please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss how we can assist.

Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson testifies during her Supreme Court confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, on March 23, 2022.Ketanji Brown Jackson's nomination brings renewed attention to lack of Black judges on the federal benchBy Chandelis Duster and Priya Krishnakumar, CNNUpdated 1644 GMT (0044 HKT) April 3, 2022 (CNN)As the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court has ignited a discussion about the historic lack of diversity on the nation's highest court, her ascendance has also renewed focus on the absence of Black judges on the federal judiciary's lower courts.Of the 3,852 people who have been confirmed as federal judges, a CNN analysis of data from the Federal Judicial Center shows that 240 of them -- 6% -- have been Black. Seventy-one of them have been Black women. More than three-quarters of all the judges have been White men.

And while strides have been made in recent years to improve the demographic makeup of the federal bench, the judiciary still skews dramatically toward White, male judges, especially when compared to the rest of the country. Almost 80% of all Article III judges -- the federal judges who are nominated by a US president and confirmed by the US Senate -- are White, and 71% are men, with large gaps persisting in Latino, Black and women's representation in the federal courts, the data shows, despite Black Americans accounting for 12.4% of the US population. 

That lack of representation is an obstacle for aspiring judges of color in a career pipeline when it comes to openings on the Supreme Court -- while also having a negative impact on a judicial system in which judges are expected to make fair and impartial decisions on issues affecting an ever-diversifying country, experts told CNN.Read More""One thing that we know erodes public confidence in the judiciary is when judges and other judicial actors (like juries) fails to reflect the diversity of the citizens who rely on our courts to mete out impartial justice,"" Stacy Hawkins, vice dean and professor at Rutgers Law School, told CNN. ""Citizens simply lack trust in the system when the system does not appear to adequately reflect their interests."" Wide-ranging reasons for lack of representationConstance Baker Motley, former Manhattan borough president, was named by President Lyndon Johnson in 1966 to fill a vacancy on the federal district court in New York City.Up until the 1960s, the federal bench was comprised almost exclusively of White men. In 1966, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Constance Baker Motley to the Southern District of New York, making her the first Black woman to become a federal judge. In the decade to follow, the federal bench saw a substantial increase in judges of color after former President Jimmy Carter announced a priority appointing more diverse judges. Overall, only 137 Hispanic Americans have been federal judges in US history, 53 have been Asian American and four have been Native American.There is a clear partisan divide in judicial appointments, with Democratic presidents nominating more Black and non-White judges to the federal bench than Republican presidents. In total, Democratic presidents have nominated 180 Black judges to the federal judiciary, while 60 were nominated by Republicans. Among Black federal judges who are still actively serving, 115 were nominated by Democrats, and 37 were nominated by Republicans. 

President Joe Biden has also emphasized diversity in many of his judicial appointments. Just over a year into his term, 67% of his confirmed nominees to the federal bench have been non-White, the highest share of any president. By comparison, just 16% of former President Donald Trump's confirmed nominees during his term were non-White. There are several reasons for a lack of diversity on the federal bench, law experts told CNN, including systemic discrimination, bias and unequal access to opportunities in the legal profession. Other factors include underrepresentation in judicial clerkships, prestigious experiences often seen in the background of judges, and underrepresentation in law firm partnerships. Early on, US Presidents, who have the power to appoint federal judges and accept recommendations for judicial candidates from lawmakers, including senators who vote on whether to confirm those appointed, also did not prioritize appointing diverse judges. There is also the fact that federal judges are appointed to their roles for life and not a set term. ""When you combine life tenure with increases in average life span, you have few opportunities for federal judicial vacancies. So, it takes a lot of time to shift the demographic composition of the bench through the appointments process,"" Hawkins told CNN, adding that because vacancies are so limited, there are often far more qualified judicial candidates than there are seats to fill. The lack of diverse representation on the bench also has a negative impact on the de facto pipeline in which aspiring judges climb the legal profession ranks.""The lack of diversity on the bench right now also kind of contributes to the lack of diversity on that pipeline because you don't have necessarily an expansive set of networks to help folks navigate those processes,"" Alicia Bannon, director of the judiciary program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told CNN. Black lawyers are already underrepresented in the legal profession more broadly, with only 5% of all lawyers being Black, according to the American Bar Association. And while progress has been made in employment among Black law graduates, narrowing gaps in employment are still quite considerable, according to an analysis by the National Association for Law Placement released in 2021. Law school enrollment over the past decade has declined by 25%, according to a study by the American Bar Federation looking at enrollment from 1999-2019. At that time, Black and Hispanic students made up a larger share of law school enrollment since the Great Recession, but Black and Hispanic students were disproportionately enrolled in lower-ranked schools with lower rates of bar passage and post-graduation employment, the study also found. ""The pipeline for judges runs through law schools,"" said Tomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University, adding that law school candidates have to be prepared by courses studied in college and in high school. ""There is a need to pay attention to increasing and ensuring equal opportunity at all levels of the educational system and in the legal profession."" 'Visible diversity breeds visible diversity'Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer, left, administers the oath of office to US District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, right, with Jackson's husband Patrick Jackson, center, holding the Bible, during an official investiture ceremeony.  May 9, 2013.  One way to increase diversity on the federal bench is to increase the number of diverse legal professionals in the de facto pipeline to the federal bench and Black representation in law schools, experts told CNN. Judicial clerkships -- which are coveted and competitive opportunities for lawyers and graduates to shadow a judge -- allow one to gain upfront experience and insight into a judgeship itself. Law graduates of color are underrepresented in all levels of judicial clerkships, particularly at the federal level, according to an analysis by the National Association for Law Placement that was released in February 2021. Just 2.1% of Black graduates are at the federal clerkship level, the group found. US Presidents and lawmakers should also be committed to diversity in appointments and recommendations, Bannon told CNN. Role-modeling from the bench itself could also lead to a diverse pipeline and Brown-Nagin said Jackson's appointment could inspire other Black women to pursue judgeships. ""Visible diversity breeds visible diversity. Meaning, if Black women historically have not been appointed judges, then it stands to reason that Black women don't think that they're likely to be appointed judges. It's just a sort of a vicious circle,"" Brown-Nagin said. Jackson, a Harvard Law graduate who went on to serve on the federal judiciary for nearly a decade, clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer during the 1999 term; Judge Bruce M. Selya, a federal judge in Massachusetts; and US District Judge Patti Saris in Massachusetts. During her confirmation hearing, she spoke of the importance for law students of color to have access to clerkships and said her experience as a clerk ""changed the trajectory of her career."" ""It has been a part of my practice to go to schools, to reach out to young people, to tell them about clerking, to try to get them to apply to me if I can and to show them that this is something that is possible,"" Jackson said. ""If I can do it, they can do it. And I think it is to the benefit of us all to have as many different law students seeking clerkships as possible.""

National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) was today fined £264,772,619.95 following convictions for three offences of failing to comply with money laundering regulations.




Mrs Justice Cockerill, the sentencing judge at Southwark Crown Court, today said: '….it must be borne in mind that although in no way complicit in the money laundering which took place, the Bank was functionally vital. Without the Bank – and without the Bank’s failures - the money could not be effectively laundered.' 
NatWest pleaded guilty at Westminster Magistrates Court on 7 October. This is the first time the FCA has pursued criminal charges for money laundering failings.
The charges covered NatWest’s failure to properly monitor the activity of a commercial customer, Fowler Oldfield, a jewellery business based in Bradford, between 8 November 2012 to 23 June 2016. When taking on the customer, NatWest initially understood it would not handle cash from the Fowler Oldfield business. However, over the course of the customer relationship approximately £365m was deposited with the bank, of which around £264m was in cash.
Some of the bank’s employees, who were responsible for handling these cash deposits, reported their suspicions to bank staff responsible for investigating suspected money laundering, however no appropriate action was ever taken. The ‘red flags’ that were reported included significant amounts of Scottish bank notes deposited throughout England, deposits of notes carrying a prominent musty smell, and individuals acting suspiciously when depositing cash in NatWest branches. In addition, the bank’s automated transaction monitoring system incorrectly recognised some cash deposits as cheque deposits. As cheques carry a lower money laundering risk than cash, this was a significant gap in the bank’s monitoring of a large number of customers depositing cash, of which Fowler Oldfield was one.
A separate investigation by West Yorkshire Police has led to 11 people pleading guilty to charges relating to the cash deposits and three cash couriers being charged. A further 13 individuals are awaiting trial at Leeds Crown Court on 25 April 2022 in relation to the activities of Fowler Oldfield.
Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:
'NatWest is responsible for a catalogue of failures in the way it monitored and scrutinised transactions that were self-evidently suspicious. Combined with serious systems failures, like the treatment of cash deposits as cheques, these failures created an open door for money laundering.
'Anti-money laundering controls are a vital part of the fight against serious crime, like drug trafficking, and such failures are intolerable ones that let down the whole community, which, in this case, justified the FCA’s first criminal prosecution under the Money Laundering Regulations.'
Notes to editors
The fine reflected a discount for the plea of guilty. The figure before 1/3 reduction for plea is £397,156,944.14.
Sentencing remarks: 
NatWest failed to comply with Money Laundering Regulations (2007). The Money Laundering Regulations 2007 came into force on 15 December 2007 and form part of the UK’s legislative framework designed to prevent the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing. They were superseded by the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017. 
Full details of the case against NatWest are available in the following agreed Statement of Facts  
National Westminster Bank Plc is a subsidiary of NatWest Group Plc (formerly the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc).

Europe's human rights court has ordered Italy to pay Amanda Knox around 18,000 euros ($20,000) in financial damages for police failure to provide legal assistance and a translator during questioning following the Nov. 1, 2007 killing of her British roommate. The European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg, France, on Thursday ruled that Italy must pay Knox 10,400 euros damages plus 8,000 euros for costs and expenses.

Europe’s human rights court on Thursday ordered Italy to pay Amanda Knox financial damages for police failure to provide legal assistance and a translator during a long night of questioning following the Nov. 1, 2007 murder of her British roommate. But the court said there was insufficient evidence to support claims of psychological and physical mistreatment at the hands of police.
The European Human Rights Court in Strasbourg, France, said in its ruling that Italy hadn’t succeeded in proving that “the restriction of Ms. Knox’s access to a lawyer … had not irreparably undermined the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.” It ordered damages that Italy must pay Knox 18,400 euros ($27,000) in damages, costs and expenses.“Ms. Knox had been particularly vulnerable, being a foreign young woman, 20 at the time, not having been in Italy for very long and not being fluent in Italian,” the court noted.

 After more than seven years of legal battles and flip-flop decisions, Knox, now 31, was definitively acquitted of Meredith Kercher’s murder by Italy’s highest court in March 2015, but a damaging conviction for falsely accusing a Congolese bar owner of the murder was confirmed, leaving a cloud over her acquittal.WATCH: Amanda Knox, former boyfriend acquitted of 2007 murder in Italy (2015) It was during questioning in the wee hours of Nov. 6, 2007 that Knox accused Patrick Lumumba, the owner of a bar where she sometimes worked, of the murder. Knox’s defence had long claimed that the accusation was coerced. The court noted she had quickly and repeatedly retracted the statement, citing a hand-written statement on the afternoon of Nov. 6, 2007, another for her lawyers three days later and in a wiretapped call to her mother on Nov. 10, 2007.

 Knox’s defence attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said the decision “is not a big surprise for me because the supreme court already said there were many mistakes. That is one of the reasons that invited us to tell Amanda to go to Strasbourg.”WATCH: Amanda Knox says she is grateful to have her life back (2015) “For me this is a certification of a mistake, probably the biggest legal mistake in the last years in Italy, also because the attention that this case has had,” Dalla Vedova said. He said he was considering whether to challenge the standing conviction for malicious false accusations.“It is impossible to compensate Amanda for four years in prison for a mistake. There will be no amount. We are not looking for compensation of damages. We are doing this on principal,” he said.  Story continues below advertisement

The bank has been accused by Austrac of more than 20m breaches of money laundering and counter-terrorism laws.  Photograph: David Moir/EPABen ButlerTue 19 Nov 2019 22.53 GMTLast modified on Thu 21 Nov 2019 02.38 GMTAustralia’s financial intelligence agency has launched legal action against one of the country’s biggest banks, Westpac, accusing it of more than 23m breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws involving $11bn in transactions, including transfers potentially linked to child exploitation.In a statement filed with the federal court, Austrac said Westpac had failed to “carry out appropriate due diligence on customers sending money to the Philippines and South East Asia for known child exploitation risks”.Austrac said Westpac had been aware of the child exploitation risks relating to low-value payments made through one of its systems, LitePay, since 2013 but had not fixed them until June 2018.“Westpac still has not implemented appropriate automated detection scenarios to monitor for the known child exploitation risks through other channels,” Austrac told the court. “As a result, Westpac has failed to detect activity on its customers’ accounts that is indicative of child exploitation.”Westpac also failed to properly deal with a customer who “opened a number of Westpac accounts after serving a custodial sentence for child exploitation offences”, Austrac said.Commonwealth Bank profits slump as compliance bill surges by $1bnRead more“Westpac promptly identified activity on one account that was indicative of child exploitation, but failed to promptly review activity on other accounts.“This customer continued to send frequent low value payments to the Philippines through channels that were not being monitored appropriately.”The customer was among 12 on whom Austrac claims Westpac failed to carry out appropriate due diligence checks “with a view to identifying, mitigating and managing known child exploitation risks”.“Over a number of years, there were repeated patterns of frequent low value transactions on accounts held by each of these 12 customers that were indicative of child exploitation risks,” the regulator told the court.Austrac also accused Westpac of failing to properly assess the risk in dealing with correspondent banks with which it did business.“This is in spite of a number of correspondent banks disclosing higher ML/TF (money laundering and terror finance) risks, such as themselves having correspondent banking relationships with high risk or sanctioned countries including Iraq, Lebanon, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, and Democratic Republic of Congo,” Austrac said.“Some correspondent banks who had disclosed such relationships had been fined by overseas regulators for sanctions or AML/CTF breaches resulting from inadequate controls.“The risk posed to Westpac was that these high risk or sanctioned countries may have been able to access the Australian payment system through these nested arrangements, unbeknownst to Westpac.”Austrac also said that between November 2013 and September 2018, Westpac failed to give it reports within the 10 days required by law about almost three-quarters of the incoming fund transfers it received from overseas banks – some 19.5m transactions totalling more than $11bn.In addition, the bank failed to file timely reports about more than 12,000 outbound transactions, including more than 2,300 sent through LitePay where “Westpac has never given Austrac a report of each of these instructions”, Austrac said.Westpac faces a theoretical maximum fine of between $391tn and $483tn, but if the breaches are found by the court it is unlikely to be ordered to pay anywhere near that amount.However, based on Austrac’s recent track record, any penalty would be likely to be extremely large.Last year, rival big four bank CBA agreed to pay Austrac $700m to settle a similar action against it in which the regulator alleged more than 53,000 breaches of AML-CTF laws.Westpac revealed it was under investigation by Austrac in November last year.“The group has recently self-reported to Austrac a failure to report a large number of international funds transfer instructions,” the bank said in its 2018 annual report.“No provision has been raised for this matter including in relation to any potential regulatory action.”In a statement to the stock exchange on Wednesday morning, Westpac said it was “reviewing Austrac’s statement of claim and will issue a further statement to the ASX once it has been assessed”.The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he was “appalled” by the allegations but the lawsuit proved Austrac was doing its job.The bank is expected to make a further statement later on Wednesday.Westpac shares fell 2.15% to $25.98 on Wednesday morning.TopicsBanking BusinessAustralian security and counter-terrorismBankingWestpacnewsReuse this contentMost

Angered by the West’s economic sanctions, President Vladimir Putin ordered that “unfriendly” countries must start paying for Russian natural gas in roubles, a demand that ministers from the G7 group of countries refused. Gas prices began to rise at the prospect that Mr Putin would turn off the taps. On March 30th Germany began bracing for the worst, taking its first step towards gas rationing. By the end of the day, however, the German government said it had received assurances that European firms would not have to make payments in roubles.Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Listen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKEven if an embargo has been averted, the latest confrontation surely strengthens Europe’s desire to relax Mr Putin’s grip on the economy. The EU has vowed to slash imports of natural gas from Russia, which made up some 40% of its consumption of the fuel last year, by two-thirds by the end of 2022. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, dreams that the EU can “get rid” of Russian imports entirely within a few years. Can America, one of the world’s largest natural-gas exporters, help fill the gap?When the Trump administration tried to persuade European officials to reduce their reliance on Russian energy by implementing policies to import more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from America—which it dubbed “molecules of freedom”—the proposal was ridiculed. Yet President Joe Biden finds himself doing something very similar to his predecessor. On March 25th he and Ms von der Leyen announced a “groundbreaking” plan to help end the EU’s reliance on Russian gas. It calls for American help in securing an additional 15bn cubic metres of LNG for Europe this year (equal to roughly a tenth of total European imports of Russian gas in 2021). It also promises to “ensure additional EU market demand” for 50bn cubic metres per year of the fuel from America by 2030.Industry insiders have greeted the ambitious plan with scepticism. One reason is that American gas companies face severe infrastructure constraints. The share of American exports going to Europe shot up from 4% in 2017 to almost 30% last year (equivalent to 22bn cubic metres), as prices soared on the continent. America “has almost 100% of its liquefaction capacity already in use”, reckons Rystad, a research firm, meaning that “there is no additional LNG to be exported” in the short term. Jack Fusco, boss of Cheniere, a big American energy company, confirms that his firm is “maxed out”. It would take four or five years and tens of billions of dollars in investment, not to mention the fast-tracking of regulatory approvals, to change that.There are also questions about whether the EU has the infrastructure to cope with the imports. Receiving cargoes of LNG and converting them into usable natural gas requires big facilities for regasification. Europe has spare capacity, but much of it is on the coasts of western countries like Spain and France. Poor interconnections mean that these are not very useful in getting imports to eastern parts of the EU, where an embargo would hit hardest. Germany, which has no LNG terminals, has vowed to build two, but that will take several years. Some European countries talk of acquiring floating LNG terminals, which can be set up more quickly—but there is a severe global shortage of them.Look to the longer term, though, and the new approach to natural gas shows more promise. That is because the EU appears ready to jettison its misguided hostility to long-term gas contracts, which it had discouraged as part of its effort to boost spot markets for gas. The intent had been to promote competition, but, as last winter’s rocketing gas prices revealed, it also left Europe badly exposed to a supply shock. As a top American LNG exporter explains, Europe focused on expanding the spot market when it should have secured “fantastic” long-term pricing instead.Now the commission says it will encourage long-term contracts “to support final investment decisions on both LNG export and import infrastructure”. That should give investors in American export facilities the confidence to spend the billions required, boosting transatlantic trade. Giles Farrer of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, reckons that the infrastructure needed to achieve the aim of 50bn cubic metres of liquefaction capacity in America would cost roughly $25bn, not including upstream investments and supply-chain inflation. Rystad thinks the spending needed to meet Europe’s extra demand could be in the region of $35bn.Diversification away from Russia in the long term, then, may be possible. But that does little to help with the short-term problem of an aggressive Mr Putin. A rational calculus suggests that he should be unwilling to turn off the taps, considering he profits handsomely from high prices. Energy Intelligence, an industry publisher, reckons Gazprom earned $20.5bn from European gas sales in the first two months of the year, nearly as much as it made from Europe in all of 2020. But few observers would dare to predict the actions of an increasingly erratic dictator. ■For more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics, business and markets, sign up to Money Talks, our weekly newsletter.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""A little help from a friend""Reuse this contentThe Trust ProjectMore from Finance & economicsDiversionary tacticsWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?Side channelsIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketButtonwoodCan the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?Wounded bearUnder unprecedented sanctions, how is the Russian economy faring?More from Finance & economicsWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketThe question is how to pay for Russian oilCan the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?Past experience suggests soft landings are rareWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketThe question is how to pay for Russian oilCan the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?Past experience suggests soft landings are rareUnder unprecedented sanctions, how is the Russian economy faring?Better than you might thinkSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentThe Trust ProjectHelp and contact usKeep updatedFacebookInstagramTwitterLinkedInYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreStoreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist EventsWorking HereWhich MBA?GMAT TutorGRE TutorExecutive JobsExecutive Education NavigatorExecutive Education: The New Global OrderExecutive Education: Business WritingTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCopyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2022.

Thorncroft was the former Chair of the Association of UK Payment Institutions who worked with lawmakers and financial regulators providing anti-money laundering advice and training.Thorncroft held himself out as a money laundering expert whose role was to protect members of the public and businesses from economic crime. However, he was a professional enabler to fraudsters, allowing his business to transfer their criminal proceeds abroad.An investigation by the Metropolitan Police, which began in 2016, found evidence that linked Thorncroft to an investment fraud which took place in 2014. This investigation revealed that Thorncroft had allowed his Money Service Bureau business to be used by the fraudsters to transfer money to Hong Kong and China.The CPS and the police were able to prove that Thorncroft should have known or suspected that the money passing through his business’s bank accounts was criminal property. Despite his substantial knowledge and expertise of money laundering, Thorncroft failed to alert the authorities to the suspicious activity and allowed it to continue.Stephane Pendered of the CPS said: “Dominic Thorncroft did not commit the fraud himself. However, his actions have allowed £850,000 defrauded from 60 individuals to be dispersed across the world.“Thorncroft promoted himself as an anti-money laundering expert but failed to live up to the standards he set for others, so when his business was clearly being used to launder criminal property, he failed to follow his own advice and report what was happening to the authorities.”The CPS is committed to continue to work alongside law enforcement to bring prosecutions where professional enablers are seen to assist criminals in this way. The CPS is also committed to working more widely with banks, businesses, charities and beyond, to help educate others so that they can avoid becoming victims of economic crime.This case was prosecuted by the Specialist Fraud Division of the CPS, a dedicated prosecuting team which deals with the most serious, complex, and difficult economic crime cases, including corruption and money-laundering.Detective Sergeant Mark Hoddinott, from the Central Specialist Crime Command (Economic Crime), Metropolitan Police, said: ""This was a really complex fraud investigation where a person with serious responsibilities and knowledge of the regulations around anti-money laundering failed in their duties to make the required disclosures to the authorities.“If Thorncroft had complied with his own company policies then he would not have been prosecuted. Instead, he paid absolutely no regards to his overriding duty to anti-money regulations; consequently, many individuals suffered great financial loss and considerable personal trauma.""In his role as the chairperson of AUKPI, Dominic Thorncroft worked closely with law makers, regulators, banks, and other financial institutions, representing the interests of the money remittance sector. The AUKPI provided its members with anti-money laundering training. Mr Thorncroft has clearly betrayed his AUKPI members and ruined his career.  ""Thornicroft’s failings cost the sixty-plus victims more than three quarters of a million pounds and allowed an overseas fraudster to profit from their misery.""I'm really pleased that a dedicated team of Met officers investigating this case have secured this conviction, especially to Detective Constable Silje Mikkelsen for her investigative tenacity and commitment to supporting the victims. I would also like to express my thanks and gratitude go out to the jury who I am sure at times found the case being presented before them complex and possibly confusing.""Today's conviction is a reminder to those working in the regulated sector of their duties when it comes to money laundering regulations.”Notes to editorsStephane Pendered is a specialist prosecutor for the CPS Specialist Fraud DivisionThe Specialist Fraud Division is a dedicated CPS team playing a leading role in the fight against serious and complex economic crime and the financial exploitation of the public, using specialist legal expertise to deliver justiceThe CPS Economic Crime Strategy 2025 is available on our websiteCPS News CentreFind out what's new at the Crown Prosecution Service's digital News Centre.Browse & searchRelated Prosecution GuidanceMoney Laundering Offences

U.K. bank hit with huge fine over anti-money laundering lapses



The NatWest sanction follows the regulator’s first criminal prosecution for money-laundering violations

After pleading guilty to violating provisions of anti-money laundering rules, U.K. bank National Westminster Bank Plc (NatWest) was hit with a £264.8-million fine.
The sanctions follow the first criminal prosecution for money laundering failings by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). 







NatWest pleaded guilty and was convicted for three offences of failing to comply with money laundering regulations.
According to the FCA, the charges stemmed from NatWest’s failure to properly monitor the activity of jewellery business Fowler Oldfield between November 2012 to June 2016.
During that time, the company deposited approximately £365 million with the bank, including £264 million in cash.
“Some of the bank’s employees, who were responsible for handling these cash deposits, reported their suspicions to bank staff responsible for investigating suspected money laundering, however no appropriate action was ever taken,” the FCA said.
Following an investigation by West Yorkshire Police, 11 people pleaded guilty to charges relating to the cash deposits and three cash couriers were charged. Another 13 people are awaiting trial in the case. The trial is set for April 2022.
Justice Cockerill, the sentencing judge at Southwark Crown Court, said that while the bank was “in no way complicit” in the money laundering, it was “functionally vital.”
“Without the bank — and without the bank’s failures — the money could not be effectively laundered,” the judge said.
Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said NatWest was responsible for “a catalogue of failures” in how it scrutinised suspicious transactions.
“Combined with serious systems failures, like the treatment of cash deposits as cheques, these failures created an open door for money laundering,” he said in a release.
“We deeply regret that we failed to adequately monitor one of our customers between 2012 and 2016 for the purpose of preventing money laundering,” NatWest CEO Alison Rose said in a statement.
“While today’s hearing brings an end to this case, we will continue to invest significant resources in the ongoing fight against financial crime.”

Anti-money laundering expert convicted for failure to report money laundering


The former chairman of the Association of UK Payment Institutions, which represents payment institutions regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, has been convicted in relation to an £850,000 investment fraud.Dominic Thorncroft was found guilty of failing to alert the authorities to money laundering, retaining wrongful credit (a theft offence) and breaching money laundering regulations.Thorncroft was a self-described money laundering expert whose job was to protect individuals and businesses from economic crime. He also allowed his business accounts to be used by fraudsters to transfer money to Hong Kong and China.Stephane Pendered of the Crown Prosecution Service said, “Thorncroft promoted himself as an anti-money laundering expert but failed to live up to the standards he set for others, so when his business was clearly being used to launder criminal property, he failed to follow his own advice and report what was happening to the authorities.”Crucially, Thorncroft did not commit fraud himself. However, it can be a criminal offence to allow money laundering and to fail to report suspicions or knowledge of money laundering to the authorities.Your business may also be subject to money laundering regulations, and if so, staying on the right side of the law should be a major concern for you.Here, we outline when someone may be penalised for failing to comply with requirements to detect, report and prevent money laundering.What is Money laundering?Money laundering is defined under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (PoCA) as a range of offences “concerning the possession, concealment, conversion, transfer or making of arrangements relating to the proceeds of crime. This is not limited to money or cash”.It is the “process by which the proceeds of crime are converted into assets which appear to have a legitimate origin”.There are two types of money laundering offences:Those who commit money laundering offences and launder the proceeds of crime.Those who only launder the proceeds of crime committed by others.We are concerned with the second type of money laundering offences.The laws behind anti-money launderingAnti-money laundering in the UK is comprised of various laws and regulations, including:The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (PoCA) – the primary law covering money laundering.The Terrorism Act 2000 (TACT) – which focuses on terrorism financing.The Money Laundering Regulations – place anti-money laundering obligations on certain higher-risk private sector industries.Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA) – intended to smooth the Brexit transition in relation to international anti-money laundering standards.What types of business have anti-money laundering duties?Businesses in certain sectors – including accountants, estate agents and financial service businesses – are required to comply with the money laundering regulations and must be monitored by the relevant supervisory authority.Some businesses are regulated by an industry specific body, such as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).If a business is not already supervised but it falls into one of seven categories, it must register with HMRC to be able to carry out the typical kinds of activities associated with their type of business. These seven business types are:Money service businesses not supervised by the FCAHigh value dealersTrust or company service providers not supervised by the FCA or professional bodyEstate agentsBill payment services not supervised by the FCATelecommunications, digital and IT payment service providers not supervised by the FCAArt market participantsLetting agenciesIf a business trades without registering, it is a criminal offence.Under the Money Laundering Regulations, supervisory bodies can investigate and impose penalties for breaches.Where a breach of regulations is serious, the body will usually refer the case to criminal enforcement authorities such as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).Failure to comply with the Regulations may lead to criminal offences under PoCA and TACT.What are businesses’ anti-money laundering obligations?Businesses affected by Money Laundering Regulations have responsibilities in their day-to-day course of business to carry out ‘customer due diligence’. This essentially means that customers are who they say they are and that their transactions are legitimate.Such obligations include appointing a ‘nominated officer’, providing sufficient training to employees and record keeping.Money laundering criminal offencesRegulation 45 of the Money Laundering RegulationsRegulation 45 creates the offence for failing to comply with money laundering regulations. It is an ‘either-way offence’, which means it can be tried in either the Magistrates’ Court or Crown Court. Conviction can result in a maximum prison sentence on indictment (conviction in the Crown Court) of up to two years and a fine.It is a defence if the accused took all reasonable steps and exercised sufficient due diligence.Regulation 47 provides that a corporate body (such as a limited company) can also commit an offence under Regulation 45 with the consent, connivance or neglect of one of its officers, in which case both the individual and corporate body can be prosecuted.Failure to disclose – Section 330 Proceeds of Crime Act 2002Under section 330 of PoCA, it is a criminal offence for a business in a regulated sector to fail to disclose knowledge or suspicions of money laundering to a ‘nominated officer’.The offence is committed where a person:Receives information in the course of business.Knows or suspects or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in money laundering.Can identify that person or where the laundered money is (or can assist in identification or finding the whereabouts).Fails to disclose to a ‘nominated officer’.Failure to disclose is an ‘either-way’ offence with a maximum penalty on indictment (conviction in the Crown Court) of up to five years imprisonment and a fine.Get specialist advice about money laundering investigations and prosecutions in BournemouthIf you are being faced with investigation or prosecution for a money laundering offence, you need advice from a lawyer who specialises in this area.We are a dedicated criminal defence firm in Bournemouth, Dorset and one of the leading teams of criminal lawyers in the region.

Tencent also failed to fully comply with rules around checking the identity of merchants and individuals as well as the source of their funds, the newspaper said.Tencent was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC Monday.Shares in the tech firm fell nearly 10% to close at 331.80 Hong Kong dollars ($42.38), their lowest closing level since Dec. 5, 2019.Since a record high close of 766.50 Hong Kong dollars in January 2021, Tencent shares have shed around 56%, wiping off more than $500 billion of value off the company.The WSJ report comes after more than a year of intense regulatory tightening by Beijing on the country's technology sector that has sought to rein in the power and stamp out some of the alleged bad behaviors of the biggest technology companies. China has sought to introduce regulation in areas ranging from anti-trust to data protection.A particular focus of regulators has been non-bank financial players such as Tencent and Alibaba-affiliate Ant Group. These companies offer financial services but traditionally without the strict regulation that banks face. China is looking to change that.Tencent has, so far, managed to escape a major regulatory blow, unlike Alibaba and Meituan which have both been hit with anti-trust fines.The Wall Street Journal said that Tencent's potential fine could be at least hundreds of millions of yuan, but it is still under deliberation.The Hong Kong-listed shares of other Chinese tech names also took a battering on Monday as already-fragile sentiment towards the country's internet sector continues to get tested.China is facing a new wave of Covid infections across the country leading to lockdowns in cities and factories closing. Meanwhile, investors are still on edge about whether U.S.-listed Chinese companies could face delistings and if Beijing's regulatory onslaught will continue.TVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT |   ETListenTVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT |   ETListenSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockAdvertise With UsJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

In the coming weeks NatWest, one of Britain’s largest lenders, is set to appear in court in London to respond to charges that it failed to properly scrutinise a gold-dealing client that deposited £365m ($502m) with the bank—£264m of it in cash.Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.Listen to this storySave time by listening to our audio articles as you multitaskOKNatWest (which has said it is co-operating with investigators) is the latest lender to be accused of falling short in the fight against dirty money. Last year global banks were hit with $10.4bn in fines for money-laundering violations, an increase of more than 80% on 2019, according to Fenergo, a compliance-software firm. In January Capital One, an American bank, was fined $390m for failing to report thousands of fishy transactions. Danske Bank is still dealing with the fallout of a scandal that erupted in 2018. Over $200bn of potentially dirty money was washed through the Danish lender’s Estonian branch while executives missed or ignored a sea of red flags.These cases imply that banks remain the Achilles heel in the global war on money-laundering, despite the reams of regulations aimed at turning them into frontline soldiers in that conflict. However, closer examination suggests that the global anti-money-laundering (AML) system has serious structural flaws, largely because governments have outsourced to the private sector much of the policing they should have been doing themselves.A study published last year by Ronald Pol, a financial-crime expert, concluded that the global AML system could be “the world’s least effective policy experiment”, and that compliance costs for banks and other businesses could be more than 100 times higher than the amount of laundered loot seized. A report based on a survey of professionals, published last year by LexisNexis, an analytics firm, found that worldwide spending on AML and sanctions compliance by financial institutions (including fund managers, insurers and others, as well as banks) exceeds $180bn a year.Money-laundering was not even a crime across much of the world until the 1980s. Since then countries from Afghanistan to Zambia have been arm-twisted, particularly by America, into passing laws. The effort intensified after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and the passage of America’s Patriot Act, which targeted money trails financing terrorism and other crime.AML compliance has since become a huge part of what banks do and created large new bureaucracies. It is not unusual for firms such as HSBC or JPMorgan Chase to have 3,000-5,000 specialists focused on fighting financial crime, and more than 20,000 overall in risk and compliance.The AML push has succeeded in stamping out the most pernicious practices, such as using shell banks (those with no real customers) in sunny places to launder suitcases stuffed with drug money. But criminals have not been forced to get particularly creative: it is not much more difficult today than it was 20 years ago to rinse dirty money by setting up a shell company, disguising the loot flowing through it as legitimate revenue and persuading an established bank to process it.As a result, the numbers tell of a war being lost. The “Global Threat Assessment”, a report by John Cusack, an ex-chair of the Wolfsberg Group, an association of banks that helps develop AML standards, estimates that $5.8trn-worth of financial crime was perpetrated in 2018—equivalent to 6.7% of global GDP. Statistics on how much is intercepted by authorities are patchy. A decade-old estimate by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime put it at just 0.2% of the total. In 2016 Europol estimated the confiscation rate in Europe to be a higher but still paltry 1.1%.Some experts think the success rate may have fallen in recent years, in part because of the rise of “trade-based money-laundering”—which moves dodgy money into the legitimate economy by playing tricks with paperwork for cross-border trade. The covid-19 pandemic, too, has boosted opportunities for financial ne’er-do-wells. Criminals have set up shell companies to exploit vast, poorly policed government-aid schemes. In Britain, the authorities have received more than 50,000 reports of potential misuse of its “Bounce Back Loans” and furlough schemes.Shell shockThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental body that sets global AML standards, admits to problems with the system. Last October its president, Marcus Pleyer, accused the “vast majority” of countries of failing to tackle money-laundering. Some countries have been able to achieve solid marks in the organisation’s assessments by passing nice-looking AML laws, only to water them down later or fail to implement key provisions. One offender is the United Arab Emirates, where weak enforcement has helped Dubai become a haven for corrupt capital. But America and Britain also look to game the FATF process, albeit less egregiously.Global efforts to stamp out money-laundering have, if anything, waned over the past five years, says Robert Barrington of the University of Sussex. In 2016 David Cameron, Britain’s then prime minister, hosted a global anti-corruption summit, and other governments queued up to back the cause. But it proved a false dawn. Britain became distracted by Brexit. In America, President Donald Trump showed scant leadership on the issue. China and Russia have stymied attempts to co-ordinate action against corruption.Three big problems hobble the fight against financial crime: a lack of transparency; a lack of collaboration; and a lack of resources. Start with transparency. Investigators often struggle to identify the real, “beneficial”, owners of shell companies, who often hide behind legal nominees.Some progress has been made in increasing visibility. Britain launched a public register of company owners in 2016, spurring several others to follow suit. Britain’s offshore satellites, such as the British Virgin Islands and Jersey, have been pressed into setting up registers or strengthening existing ones. America recently passed a law requiring ownership data on firms registered at state level, including in Delaware’s incorporation factories, to be held in a federal register.However, many countries still eschew registers, and those that have them have faced problems. In Britain criminals have been willing to risk filing false information, or none at all, given the modest penalties for doing so. Hong Kong, meanwhile, plans to scale back the details company owners must disclose on its register.The FATF is seeking to toughen its standard on beneficial-ownership transparency; the current version says merely that “competent authorities” should have access to such information “in a timely fashion”. But getting its 39 core members—from America and the EU to China and Russia—to agree on a new text will be difficult.The second problem, lack of collaboration, hobbles governments’ work with each other, and with banks on the front line. The big money-laundering schemes are sophisticated and transnational, while anti-laundering efforts remain balkanised. Information-sharing between governments is improving, thanks to co-operation among “financial-intelligence units”, national centres that collect data on suspicious transactions. But the “mutual legal assistance” system, which countries investigating crimes use to request information from each other, is clunky.As for data flowing to and from banks, the benefits of sharing are indisputable. “The value of information coming from a network of banks is thousands of times higher than the information any one bank has, because you can see not just where the money came from, but where it went, and where it went from there, and so on,” says the head of a large international bank. Unfortunately, the level of collaboration is “terrible”. America does best, thanks to the Patriot Act, but even there information-sharing is “on a tiny scale”. Anything more requires a warrant from a judge, “which is hard if you don’t know what the crime is yet”. Britain is in second place, he says, with “about 30%” of the data-sharing done in America. And in third place? “No one.”A daunting obstacle to sharing information is data-privacy laws, which in many places prevent banks from passing information to authorities, particularly foreign ones. Some big banks have lobbied for exceptions to be made for AML, but “governments don’t see it as a legislative priority”, says an executive at another bank.The third difficulty, a dearth of resources, stems from the fact that white-collar crime is less visible than violent crime. Spending on curbing the latter goes down better with the public. In Britain, fraud makes up more than a third of reported crime, yet gets less than 1% of police resources in terms of officers. Banks can spend all they like on AML, but the criminals won’t end up in court if governments fail to invest in policing and prosecution.Many crime-fighting agencies lack the funding to properly analyse the torrent of “suspicious-activity reports” (SARS) banks file when they spot potentially dodgy transactions. SARs are a cornerstone of the system. But banks file too many low-quality or unnecessary reports because they are incentivised to cover their backs rather than to apply sensible risk criteria. Globally they file millions of SARs a year; in America alone, about 1.2m were submitted by deposit-takers last year (see chart).Red-tape revolutionIf the AML system is to be fit for purpose, then governments must work harder together. “Blaming banks for not ‘properly’ implementing [AML] laws is a convenient fiction,” Mr Pol’s report concluded. It also gives an unfair pass to the non-bank actors that enable corruption. While fines for banks with poor AML controls have risen relentlessly, lawyers who set up dodgy shell companies, accountants who sign off on their fishy filings and the like have been getting away with slaps on the wrist. Britain’s revenues and customs agency, for instance, supervises more than 30,000 accountants, estate agents and other businesses for money-laundering purposes; in the 2019-20 financial year it issued just 31 fines, averaging £290,000. Governments also need to get to grips with the AML implications of cryptocurrencies, and the firms and exchanges that hawk them.Activists who campaign to fix the cracks in the global AML architecture are pinning much hope on the Biden administration, which has said that it views the fight against corruption as a national-security issue and therefore a priority. Whether it can work more profitably than its predecessor with Europe, which is overhauling AML oversight in the wake of the Danske debacle, remains to be seen. Hopes that China can be persuaded to co-operate are not high. Either way, bankers should probably brace for another beating. ■A version of this article appeared online on April 12th, 2021.This article appeared in the Finance & economics section of the print edition under the headline ""Losing the war""Reuse this contentThe Trust ProjectMore from Finance & economicsA little help from a friendAmerica’s gas frackers limber up to save EuropeDiversionary tacticsWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?Side channelsIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketButtonwoodCan the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?Wounded bearUnder unprecedented sanctions, how is the Russian economy faring?More from Finance & economicsAmerica’s gas frackers limber up to save EuropeThere might be little they can do in the short termWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketThe question is how to pay for Russian oilAmerica’s gas frackers limber up to save EuropeThere might be little they can do in the short termWhat can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?China and India sniff a bargainIndia grapples with the new realities of the global oil marketThe question is how to pay for Russian oilCan the Fed pull off an “immaculate disinflation”?Past experience suggests soft landings are rareUnder unprecedented sanctions, how is the Russian economy faring?Better than you might thinkSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentThe Trust ProjectHelp and contact usKeep updatedFacebookInstagramTwitterLinkedInYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in “a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.” The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreStoreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist EventsWorking HereWhich MBA?GMAT TutorGRE TutorExecutive JobsExecutive Education NavigatorExecutive Education: The New Global OrderExecutive Education: Business WritingTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCopyright © The Economist Newspaper Limited 2022.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Friday, April 1, 2022 
MS-13 Leader Sentenced to Life in Federal Prison for Racketeering Conspiracy and Murder
Defendant Directed and/or Participated in Murders in Maryland and Virginia
A New Jersey man was sentenced to life in prison today for murder in aid of racketeering; conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering; conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, cocaine, and heroin; and possession with intent to distribute heroin.
Miguel Angel Corea Diaz aka Reaper, 41, of Long Branch, a leader in the transnational criminal enterprise La Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13, was convicted by a federal jury on Nov. 23, 2021, after a four-week trial. Co-defendant Junior Noe Alvarado-Requeno aka Insolente and Trankilo, 24, of Landover, Maryland, was also convicted at trial and faces a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. He is scheduled to be sentenced on April 25.
According to court documents, MS-13 is a transnational gang composed primarily of immigrants or descendants from El Salvador. MS-13 has branches or “cliques” that operate throughout Frederick County, Anne Arundel County, Prince George’s County, and Montgomery County, Maryland and elsewhere on the East Coast. 
“The brutality of Corea Diaz is almost unfathomable,” said U.S. Attorney Erek L. Barron for the District of Maryland. “We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to remove these violent gang members to keep our communities safe from the violence perpetrated by MS-13. With the help of members of our communities we will work to bring to justice those MS-13 members who commit these horrible crimes.”
“As members of MS-13, Corea Diaz and his co-conspirators were ruthless and showed no regard for human life by extorting innocent people, tampering with witnesses, and ordering a murder over a drug dispute,” said Assistant Director in Charge Steven M. D’Antuono of the FBI Washington Field Office. “With today’s sentence, Corea Diaz will no longer be able to commit senseless violence and homicidal acts on our streets. The FBI remains steadfast in our resolve to work with our partners to ensure that individuals like Corea Diaz are held accountable for their crimes and to eliminate MS-13's violence from our communities.”
“The ruthlessness of MS-13 in pursuit of profits shows a clear link between violence and the illicit drug trade,” said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. “Today’s sentence won’t undo the harm Diaz is responsible for, but it ensures that for the rest of his life, he will no longer be a direct threat to the communities he terrorized for so long. DEA will continue to work tirelessly with our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to ensure violent criminals like Diaz are taken off the streets, helping to make American communities safer and healthier.”
“Any time we can get a notorious gang member off the streets, it is a victory for both law enforcement and law-abiding citizens,” said Special Agent in Charge James R. Mancuso of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Baltimore. “In this case, the criminal is particularly violent, and now he will face the consequences of his crimes.  HSI is grateful to have worked with our partnering federal and local law enforcement agencies to make the communities safer for the citizens of Maryland, Washington, D.C., and Virginia.”
According to evidence presented at trial, between 2015 and 2018, Corea Diaz and his co-defendant Alvarado-Requeno controlled and operated the Sailors Locos Salvatruchos Westside (S.L.S.W. or Sailors) Clique. This Sailors Clique was involved in a host of significant criminal activity including murder, extortion, drug trafficking, money laundering, and witness tampering. Evidence showed that the gang ran a “protection” scheme in and around its home base in Langley Park, Maryland, and extorted local businesses by charging them “rent” for the privilege of operating in MS-13 “territory.” The gang also trafficked in illegal drugs, including heroin and cocaine. A large share of the proceeds of the gang’s illegal activities were sent to gang leadership in El Salvador using structured transactions and intermediaries to avoid law enforcement scrutiny.
According to evidence presented at trial, the Sailors Clique committed acts of violence against suspected rival gang members, as well as against its own membership for breaking gang rules. In March 2017, a member of the Sailors Clique who was hiding from law enforcement in the Lynchburg, Virginia, area had a dispute with a local high school student over marijuana. In response, Corea-Diaz and Alvarado-Requeno organized a squad of MS-13 members to drive down to Lynchburg and murder the minor. The gang members kidnapped the student from his front lawn and cut his hand off before killing him. After the murder, Corea Diaz and Alvarado-Requeno helped to hide and protect the killers from law enforcement.
The FBI and HSI investigated the case, with valuable assistance provided by the DEA’s Washington and New York Field Divisions, the Prince George’s County Police Department, the Montgomery County Police Department, the Bedford County Sherriff’s Office, and the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office.
Trial Attorneys Julie Finocchiaro and Alexander Gottfried of the Criminal Division’s Organized Crime and Gang Section and U.S. Attorney Timothy Hagan for the District of Maryland prosecuted the case.

Only one conviction in last four years under AML law, MPs panel told


By Our Correspondent 

December 02, 2021 










ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has informed the National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance that the tax authorities have attached properties worth Rs235 billion, in total 215 registered FIRs, during the last four years under the Anti Money Laundering (AML) law.




The National Assembly's Standing Committee on Finance met under chairmanship of Faiz Ullah here at the Parliament House on Wednesday. When the parliamentarians inquired about convictions before a court of law under the AML to satisfy the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the FBR high-ups replied that the first conviction was achieved in a case based in Peshawar related to Inland Revenue (IR).However, there was no conviction on Customs side, said FBR’s Director General Intelligence & Investigation of Inland Revenue Aamir Talpur, while testifying before the NA panel. “To implement the AML Law, we have registered 215 FIRs against 267 accused and attached properties worth Rs235 billion involving a tax amount of Rs76 billion. The FBR also attached 640 bank accounts.The Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) sends us Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) after receiving and analyzing data from 8 to 9 relevant agencies."" The FBR cannot close down an investigation on its own, Aamir Talpur said.The Chairman of NA Panel, Faiz Ullah, raised concerns by Faisalabad's business community on the rampant use of AML laws against them and argued that tax evasion and money laundering should be dealt with separately. PMLN leader Ahsan Iqbal also argued that the laws were bulldozed in haste to pass this AML law to victimize Mian Nawaz Sharif, but now this law was being used to harrass businessmen. The Chairman FBR, Dr. Ashfaque Ahmed, said tax evasion having linkages of criminal proceeds was handed over to the jurisdiction of tax machinery. Despite limited workforce, he said that the FBR had to perform reluctantly in accordance with the mandate given by the Parliament.The FBR’s DG I&I IR, Aamir Talpur, said that Financial Monitoring Unit is the focal point for receiving all data and after analysing it, Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) are prepared, which are forwarded to the relevant law enforcing agencies. In case of tax-related issues of Income Tax or Sales Tax, the STRs were forwarded to FBR’s Inland Revenue and in case of Customs, it is forwarded to FBR’s Customs Intelligence Wing. He cited the example of an 80-year-old person who deposited multimillion rupees cash while declaring taxable income of just Rs0.2 million. He said that the FBR collected evidence and presented it before the court of law following which the properties and banks accounts were attached, he added.The PPP Parliamentarian's Dr. Nafisa Shah asked for furnishing details of Saudi loan deposit and oil facility to the tune of $4.2 billion for one year, in the next meeting at which the Director General Debt Ministry of Finance requested for an in-camera session for sharing details of the Saudi agreement.The Ministry of Finance also presented Federal Government Properties Management Bill 2021 before the committee. The new bill proposed to establish Property Management Authority under a Director General for three years tenure. Following this, a board will also be established and this Authority will have the mandate to develop properties for commercial purposes. It will have the powers to mortgage, rent, or lease out government-owned properties.PPP MNA Dr. Nafisa Shah and PMLN's Ahsan Iqbal strongly opposed the bill, arguing it would open a new Pandora's box. They asked for incorporating the viewpoint of major stakeholders such as railways, defense ministry, ports and shipping and others because neither the ministries nor the departments would be willing to hand over their properties to the proposed authority. The committee deferred its approval for the next meeting.

When he told his family he was taking the job, his father-in-law asked him: ‘Are you mad?’ Photograph: Andy Hall/The ObserverThe US executive took over the port in 2019, in the heat of the debate about the EU. He’s not surprised it’s been a challengeSat 2 Apr 2022 16.00 BSTLast modified on Mon 4 Apr 2022 11.10 BSTWhen Doug Bannister told his family he would be joining the Port of Dover as its chief executive, weeks before the original March 2019 Brexit date, his father-in-law voiced what many might have thought: “Are you mad?”The softly spoken American clearly isn’t one to shy away from a daunting task, including taking over at Britain’s busiest port during what he calls the “once in a generation” change in the country’s trading relationship with its closest neighbours.As negotiations dragged on, Brexit was delayed for another year, but when it came, the change was seismic. “It was such a significant transformation that the nation was going through, and Dover is the epicentre of that activity. And I did sign up for that,” Bannister says.Even if, on arrival, he was pleasantly surprised at the port’s preparations for Brexit, he never could have forecast the other storm clouds gathering on the horizon. Covid repeatedly disrupted traffic on Britain’s busiest trade route, halted most leisure travel for two years, and even saw France close its border in December 2020 to all travellers, including truck drivers, from England.The drop-off in traffic put pressure on the finances of the port, run by the Dover Harbour Board, which was granted a royal charter in 1606. It does not have any external shareholders, and its “trust port” status prevented it from tapping investors or going to the capital markets to raise cash during the pandemic.Freight traffic has largely returned to pre-Brexit, pre-pandemic levels at the UK’s most important “ro-ro” port (so named because vehicles roll on and roll off the ships), Bannister says, although leisure travel has been recovering more slowly. A third of all the UK’s trade in goods with the EU is handled by Dover, according to the latest figures from consultancy Oxera, which translates to a value of about £144bn. About 10,000 lorries travel through it each day – 31% of all the HGVs that visit UK seaports.CVAge 57Family Married with four children, three of whom live with him in Kent, while his eldest daughter lives in the US.Education BA in economics at St Lawrence University in New York state; MBA at Seton Hall University in New Jersey.Pay Basic salary of £300,000. In 2020 he was paid an additional £122,000 in bonuses, pension contributions and benefits.Last holiday Devon, last summer: “It was glorious.”Best advice he’s been given “Go into any change positively.” He believes “an early positive attitude” about change, “combined with early engagement, generally leads to a better outcome”.Biggest career mistake “I think I was not a good father to my first daughter. I was spending so much time working and travelling around the world for work that I missed her childhood. I have a very good relationship with her now.”Word he overuses “I probably use the word ‘wicked’ a lot.”How he relaxes Spending time with his children and in the garden.Bannister says he “fell into” his long maritime career after taking a job with small shipping group Trans Freight Lines in the US, following a degree in economics. The 57-year-old would go on to work at P&O’s container shipping division before it merged with Dutch line Royal Nedlloyd and was subsequently bought by the Danish giant Maersk.His latest challenge has arrived out of a clear blue sky: as we pulled up outside the passenger cruise terminal, an enormous symbol of it hove into view. P&O Ferries’ hulking Spirit of Britain hasn’t travelled anywhere since the company sacked 800 workers on 17 March. The 213-metre-long ferry, one of the largest operating in Europe, would usually only dock briefly at Dover during its five daily round trips between Kent and northern France.“We were looking forward to increasing passenger trade as Covid travel restrictions eased off, and so it is going to be difficult to handle that having the P&O ferries off the route. We hope they get them back sailing again in time for Easter, if not in time for the summer,” Bannister says.While P&O Ferries’ ships remain tied up, rival operators have scrambled to take extra passengers, with the port helping coordinate. Despite this, Bannister appears reluctant to pass judgment on the firm – whose chief executive effectively admitted breaching employment law by dismissing his staff without notice – or on the wider issue of rates of pay for international seafarers.Assessing wages for crew is not always straightforward as “frequently international seafarers don’t pay any income taxes, because they are not a part of any particular nation,” Bannister says. “Some routes are different, like domestic routes like the Isle of Wight or maybe up in the Scottish islands. It’s not necessarily a straight apples for apples comparison, but I do think it is right that people should get paid for the work that they do in the best way that they can be.”People will get slicker at reading passports, get slicker at lodging paperwork and checking paperwork. But we are in a different trading regimeDoug BannisterEven before the P&O scandal, port traffic had been repeatedly disrupted during the first weeks of the year, including by the introduction of new EU import controls, increased freight traffic, roadworks and a reduction in ferry services as vessels were refitted.Traffic was flowing freely on the day the Observer visited, and there was no sign of the queue of lorries frequently seen snaking up the A20 road, which winds down to the coast. Bannister believes this is partly due to traders and hauliers getting used to new requirements, which include time-consuming passport and paperwork checks.He concedes a consequence of Brexit is longer processing times at the border. “There will be improvements which are made. People will get slicker at reading passports, get slicker at lodging paperwork and checking paperwork. But we are in a different trading regime.”An impending change, which could again lead to queues at the port, is also weighing on Bannister’s mind. In September, the EU intends to introduce airport-style biometric checks at its external borders. This would affect Dover because of “juxtaposed controls”, where travellers clear French entry requirements before leaving the UK, and he has called on the British government to work with the EU on a solution.The Spirit of Britain (foreground) moored at Dover in the wake of the P&O scandal. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA“To date, no process has been identified for a carload of people transiting a busy ferry terminal on a dark stormy night,” he says. “It would force people to exit their vehicles in busy moving traffic, which would be dangerous. We couldn’t allow that to happen.”Over the centuries, Dover has capitalised on its “geographic advantage” of being located just 22 miles across the Channel from France. Bannister is convinced the recent bounceback in trade highlights the success of the “short straits”: the shortest distance between the UK and the continent. “The market has chosen,” he says. “We have three different ferry operators operating from the port, two ports in France to go to, and then the Eurotunnel running alongside us.”Bannister’s career has taken him on a circumnavigation of the globe from his home state of New Jersey to the island of Jersey – where he ran the airport and harbours – via Rotterdam, Australia (his favourite place to live and work) and New Zealand. Now, he clearly gets a kick out of working for an organisation as rich in history as this one, despite the varied challenges since he took up the role in Dover.“It’d be nice if there were a few less disruptions,” he says. “This business has been around for 400 years; it’s got incredible heritage. It’ll be here for another 400 years.”TopicsInternational tradeObserver business profileEconomicsGlobal economyBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policyinterviewsReuse this contentMost popularMost popularBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleContact usComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for usPrivacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsHelpAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInTwitterNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2022 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Sentences for money laundering getting longer: research

Immediate custodial sentences for money laundering and other regulatory breaches are getting longer, making compliance increasingly important for business.




New research by Thomson Reuters showed the average length of prison sentences handed down to people convicted of money laundering had risen from 20.5 months to 27 months between 2008 and 2018.
The increasing use of custodial sentences is likely to make companies focus on compliance with regulations. 
In the past few years the UK government has introduced a number of measures designed to reduce money laundering, including a register of beneficial ownership for UK companies and the use of unexplained wealth orders (UWOs). 
Sentencing guidelines introduced in October 2014 gave English and Welsh judges guidance on the sentencing of bribery and money laundering offences for the first time and were designed to encourage a consistent approach to the sentencing of these offences. 
UWOs were introduced in January 2018 and require individuals to explain where their wealth has come from. Bodies such as HM Revenue & Customs, the Serious Fraud Office and the National Crime Agency have the ability to apply to the High Court for a UWO to freeze and forfeit funds in bank and building society accounts.
The Thomson Reuters research, reported by the Financial Times (subscription required) also said fines for money laundering offences were now less common. In 2013 fines were handed down in 13% of money laundering cases, but this had dropped to 7% last year. 
The harm caused by economic crime is well documented and the UK government has been consistent in its determination to make it as difficult as possible for criminal proceeds to be laundered through the UK, with the introduction of tools such as UWOs and the register of beneficial ownership, with further reforms on the horizon as loopholes are closed. 
An effective deterrent depends not just on legislation and regulation, however, but on effective, consistent and transparent enforcement. The courts have the tools for this and, as we have seen with other regulatory breaches - for example, in health and safety and environmental matters - are increasingly using them to their full force to bring home the message that misconduct will not be tolerated. Immediate custodial sentences are no longer reserved for the most flagrant breaches and are becoming increasingly commonplace for a variety of regulatory misdemeanours. With such high stakes at play, compliance issues cannot be ignored.
The EU’s 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which was published in November last year and comes into force in December 2020 across the EU, proposed an increase in the minimum prison sentence for money laundering offences for individuals from one year to four years, alongside a variety of other ‘dissuasive’ sanctions. Conviction on indictment in the UK allows imprisonment for longer than this already.

Photograph: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesBen ButlerTue 1 Mar 2022 01.08 GMTLast modified on Tue 1 Mar 2022 01.10 GMTAustrac has launched court action accusing James Packer’s Crown Resorts of breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism finance laws and continuing to contravene the law due to wholly inadequate oversight by management.In a lawsuit filed with the federal court on Tuesday, Austrac, Australia’s financial intelligence agency, said ongoing failures to properly vet risky customers – including those brought in from overseas by junket operators and locals with links to people already banned from Crown’s Melbourne and Perth casinos – accounted for 547 breaches of anti-money laundering laws.Crown Resorts agrees to $9bn takeover by BlackstoneRead moreEach alleged breach of the law if proven could attract a penalty of up to $22.2m, meaning Crown faces a fine that could theoretically exceed $12bn. However, if Austrac’s action succeeds, a far smaller penalty is likely. The current record fine is $1.3bn, which Westpac agreed to pay to settle allegations by Austrac that the bank breached AML/CTF laws more than 23m times, including by allowing a dozen customers to transfer money to the Philippines in a way consistent with child exploitation.From March 2016, just 60 high-risk customers turned over $70bn at Crown’s casinos, pumping $1.1bn in losses into the company’s coffers, Austrac said in a concise statement filed with the court.Austrac alleges that Crown failed to do appropriate due diligence on these customers, which it said included junket operators and players, foreign politically exposed people – a category that can include government officials and their families – as well as people who had been arrested for money laundering or were suspected of being “connected to organised crime”.The regulator alleges that “many engaged in large cash transactions and transacted with cash that appeared suspicious, including cash in plastic bags, shoeboxes or cardboard boxes, cash in rubber bands, small denominations of notes and counterfeit cash”.James Packer admits to ‘many oversights’ at Perth Crown casino during royal commission hearingRead moreIt alleges that an additional 447 customers engaged in transactions that Crown’s external consultants later identified as typical of money laundering or terrorism finance.Some customers allegedly engaged in multiple breaches.The legal action follows an investigation that Austrac’s chief executive, Nicole Rose, said showed that Crown failed to put in place and maintain an AML/CTF program that would mitigate the risk that its casinos were misused for money laundering.“They also failed to carry out appropriate ongoing customer due diligence including on some very high-risk customers,” she said.“This led to widespread and serious non-compliance over a number of years.“Austrac has taken this strong action to achieve enduring change and ensure that Crown will fully meet their obligations to protect themselves and Australia’s financial system from criminal activity.”She said Crown was working to improve its systems, “however there is further work to do and Austrac will continue to work closely with Crown to address ongoing compliance concerns”.Crown said it was reviewing the statement of claim filed with the court by Austrac.Crown Resorts: can a ‘special manager’ clean up Melbourne’s casino?Read moreIt said it “has developed a comprehensive remediation plan which is intended to position Crown as a leader in the industry in its approach to governance, compliance, responsible gaming and the management of financial crime risk”.“The plan is underpinned by an uplifted organisational culture.”Allegations that Crown’s casinos were being used for money laundering were made by Nine Entertainment’s newspapers and its flagship current affairs TV show, 60 Minutes, in 2019.Inquiries in both NSW and Victoria found that Crown facilitated money laundering at its Melbourne and Perth casinos and that some junket operators were linked to organised crime.

Monzo Faces FCA Investigation Into Alleged AML Contraventions

London FinTech Monzo is facing an investigation from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) over allegations of possibly violating anti-money laundering (AML) laws, Financial Times reported on Friday (July 30).
Monzo CEO TS Anil said in its most recent annual report that despite a year that posed numerous obstacles, the digital bank showed fortitude and posted a “significant amount of growth,” FT reported.
The challenger bank also used its annual report to discuss the startup’s current FCA probe regarding alleged AML violations. But the report also turned the spotlight on Monzo’s ability to keep losses at bay despite early hits from the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.
Anil said Monzo has its sights set on turning a profit next year and would raise additional funds in the coming months that will power growth and help it keep a few steps ahead of regulations regarding capital.
Monzo landed over £200 million (approximately $278 million) during its last year, while the FinTech is “fielding a significant amount of inbound interest” from new and present investors, Anil said, according to the FT report.
Although the FCA’s investigations are just getting out of the gate, the probe potentially includes both criminal and civil liability, Monzo said, per FT.
“The prevention of financial crime is an issue that affects the entire banking industry and one which Monzo is taking extremely seriously. Over the past year we have made major investments in our controls in this area as a priority and will continue to invest heavily in this part of the business,” Monzo said, per FT.
Monzo is not the only challenger bank facing scrutiny over money laundering allegations. In Germany neobank N26 was ordered by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) to step up its AML efforts. BaFin mandated that N26 Bank change how it approaches IT monitoring and customer due diligence.
